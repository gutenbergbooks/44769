<h2>THE
SHEEPFOLD AND THE COMMON.</h2>

<h3>OLD RACHEL, THE BLIND WOMAN.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">"And so I hear," said Mrs. Stevens to the Rector,
when we were spending an evening at his house,
"that poor Old Rachel is dead. I really thought she
had died long since, as I have not heard anything
about her for a long time."</p>
</div>

<p>"Yes, Madam," replied Mr. Ingleby, "she is dead, and was buried
yesterday; she lies very near some of the finest of my flock."</p>

<p>"She must have lived to a great age, for she was an old woman
when I was but a little girl."</p>

<p>"She was, I believe, upwards of ninety, and for several years she
lived with some relatives in a state of almost entire seclusion. I
had quite lost sight of her, and it was owing to a very casual circumstance
that my acquaintance with her was renewed."</p>

<p>"How did you happen again to meet with her?"</p>

<p>"It was in this way. I required some one to weed my garden;
and hearing that there was an active clever woman residing at
Street, about two miles from the rectory, who was a good hand at
such work, I took a walk to find her. On reaching her house I
knocked at the door, but received no answer; and just as I was
going away, rather disappointed at having made a fruitless journey,
a neighbour stepped out of the adjoining cottage, and said, 'If,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Sir, you want Mrs. Jones, she has just gone out, but I will go and
look for her, if you will perhaps come in here, and rest yourself
for a few minutes.' I thanked her, and followed her into the house,
where she placed a chair for me, saying, as she left to go in search
of Mrs. Jones&mdash;'It's no use, Sir, to say nothing to my mother there;
she is quite blind, and so deaf, that she can't hear a word which
nobody says to her.' The person to whom she pointed sat in an
arm-chair, on the opposite side of the fire, wrapped up in flannel,
her face nearly concealed by her cap and bonnet, and as motionless
as a statue. I sat for a few moments in silence, and then, yielding
to a feeling of curiosity, and I would also hope to a better motive,
to endeavour to ascertain whether I could impart the soothing influences
of religious consolation to the seemingly inanimate object
that sat opposite to me, I arose, and placing my lips as near
her ear as possible, without touching her, said, audibly and distinctly,
'You are very old.' No reply. This was followed by
several common-place questions&mdash;such as, 'What is your name?'
'Do you want anything?' 'Are you in any pain?' These and
other questions I continued to repeat; but they produced no more
effect on her than they would have done on a log. 'Poor thing,' I
exclaimed, 'it's no use to try, as she is living out of my reach. The
door of access is locked, and the key lost.' I resumed my seat. My
anxiety to gain access to her mind increased in proportion to the
apparent impossibility of succeeding, and I made another effort. '<em>Do
you ever think about dying?</em>' There was a slight convulsive movement
of the hand, but this was no satisfactory proof that she heard
my question; however, it showed that the inner spirit was awake,
and might possibly be bringing itself to a listening attitude. I then
put the all-important question&mdash;'<em>Do you know anything about Jesus
Christ?</em>' Never shall I forget the effect of this question. Her hands
were suddenly raised, her arms extended, and her face glowed with
more than human radiance, and, in a tone of transport, she exclaimed,
'What! is that my beloved pastor? It was under your ministry
I was brought to know Christ, and feel the preciousness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
love.' This unanticipated exclamation astonished and delighted me,
especially when I recognized, by the sound of her voice, <em>Old Rachel</em>.
To all my questions relating to her secular condition and wants, she
was as insensible as though actually dead. I stood and looked on her
with joyous wonder, never having previously known a similar case.
I repeated question after question, but had no response, till I asked,
'<em>Is Christ precious to you?</em>' Her reply was prompt and audible:
<em>He is precious to my soul&mdash;my transport and my trust.</em>' The reply
had an electrical effect on my spirit. Marvellous! I never witnessed
such a scene as this. I varied my questions again and
again; but there was no sign of hearing, or even perceptible motion,
though I took hold of her hand. It was as though some angelic spirit
kept watch, to prevent any thought relating to earth or time from
obtruding itself on her attention, now she was waiting on the
verge of the celestial world. One question more, and all intercourse
was over. '<em>Do you long to see Christ?</em>' She instantly replied,
'<em>My soul is in haste to be gone.</em>' Again she relapsed into her
statue-like appearance, and in that state continued till the return
of her daughter with Mrs. Jones, after transacting my business
with whom, I took leave, and walked home, musing on the history
of Old Rachel, and resolving that I would soon again pay her a visit."</p>

<p>"I should like," said Mrs. John Roscoe, "to have witnessed this
scene, and heard the retiring spirit thus appearing to bear testimony
to the more than magic power of the Saviour's name, and of the preciousness
of his love."</p>

<p>"And so, Madam, should I," said the Rev. Mr. Guion; "it would
have been to me like a voice speaking from another world, in confirmation
of the genuineness of our faith, which sees the invisible,
and holds conscious intercourse with Him, though we hear him not.
I generally find, that a singular ending is closely connected with
a singular origin, or a series of eventful occurrences. Can you favour
us with some account of her history?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, I can, and it is both interesting and peculiar. I did
not know her till she was advanced in age, and had lost her sight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
yet, before I knew her, I had often heard her spoken of as an intelligent
woman, very fond of books, and remarkable for the neatness
and cleanliness of her person, and her regular and punctual attendance
at her parish church. When her sight failed her, she was compelled
to relinquish the school by which she had gained her livelihood;
but she was so much esteemed, that a good allowance was granted
by the parish, and this was augmented by weekly subscriptions from
some of the members of her church. On passing by her cottage one
day, I looked in to see her, though she was not one of my parishioners;
but as she had imbibed the Tractarian doctrines of her
Rector, and felt a strong repugnance to evangelical truth, I at
once perceived that my presence was more disagreeable than
pleasing. I therefore withdrew, not intending to repeat my visit
until I had prepared her to desire it. I soon hit upon a plan to
accomplish this. The old woman had a little favourite grand-daughter
in my Sabbath-school, and it occurred to me that I could
employ her as the medium of communication; and I commenced
operations by giving her and lending her some little books of anecdotes
and descriptive stories. After the lapse of several months, I
gave her, as a reward for reading to her grandmother, the sketch of
the Rev. John Newton's conversion; and this was followed by a tract
on regeneration, with which the old woman was so much pleased,
that she requested the loan of another on the same subject. No
great while after reading this tract she came to hear me preach, and
soon became a regular attendant on my ministry; and ere long she
sent to say she should be glad if I would call on her. I went; she
apologized for her rudeness of manner on my former visit, and
excused herself by referring to the influence which superstitious
prejudices had acquired over her. From these superstitions she
hoped she was now rescued by the attractive power of the gospel of
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"When it was noised abroad that Rachel, the old blind woman,
had left the church, where Tractarian doctrines and ceremonies were
the theme of the Rector's ministrations, she received a visit from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
some of her lady friends, who were very anxious to get her to return,
intimating that if she did, they would continue their subscriptions
towards her support, otherwise she must not expect to receive any
more favours from them. She heard all they chose to say, and thus
announced her final decision:&mdash;'I have, ladies, attended my parish
church for more than fifty years without getting any benefit to my
soul, but where I have been only a few Sabbaths I have heard and
felt the truth as it is in Jesus, and there I shall continue to go as long
as my feeble limbs will carry me. I thank you for all your acts of
liberality and kindness to me, but I cannot barter away my freedom,
and run the risk of losing my soul. I must live free, though in
poverty; and my salvation is now the one thing I value above all
price.' She continued for several years both regular and punctual
in her attendance on my ministry, but at length was compelled, by
increasing infirmities, to give up her house and go to reside with a
married daughter. Years rolled on&mdash;the grand-daughter had left
my school&mdash;the cottage where the old woman had resided was occupied
by another&mdash;she gradually faded from my recollection, and in
process of time I had quite forgot her."</p>

<p>"I used," said Mrs. Stevens, "to see her, with her grand-daughter
leading her, coming to church and going from it; but she sat in
some pew which concealed her from my sight when in the church."</p>

<p>"She was, Madam, one of the most retiring women I ever knew;
she had a great objection to be seen, as she knew her conversion and
her leaving the ministry of her former Rector had excited a good
deal of talk."</p>

<p>"The circumstances attending her conversion to the faith of
Christ," observed the Rev. Mr. Guion, "is an evident proof of its
genuineness, and of its having been effected by the Holy Spirit;
otherwise it would have been impossible for you to have gained her
over to the reception of salvation by grace through faith, as she was
so self-satisfied with her own Tractarian delusions, and so much
under the power of the active agents of the same fatal heresy."</p>

<p>"I must confess that no event in my long pastoral career ever gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
me more real pleasure, or excited purer emotions of gratitude to my
Divine Master, than being allowed to witness the termination of her
course&mdash;so unexpected, and so novel."</p>

<p>"I have known," said the Rev. Mr. Guion, "some delivered from
their terrors and misgivings, just prior to their departure, who
have been in bondage all their life, through fear of death, and then
they have felt even a transport of joy in anticipation of the end of
their faith, but I have never known a case like this of Old Rachel."</p>

<p>"I recollect," said Mr. Roscoe, "reading in the <cite>Times</cite>, some years
ago, the report of a case bearing a strong resemblance to it in some
of its distinctive peculiarities. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, of &mdash;&mdash;-, who had through
a very lengthened course distinguished himself by his activity in
secular life, and by his practical piety, when drawing near his latter
end, appeared quite indifferent, if not positively insensible, to everything
bearing a relation to earth, though surrounded by its wealth
and honours; but even then he gave unmistakeable signs to his
pious relatives, that he was filled with all joy and peace in believing,
abounding in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lewellin remarked:&mdash;"An intimate friend related to me, some
time since, the following circumstances, which belong to the same
remarkable order with that of Old Rachel and Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;. He
knew a Mr. Griffith, who left Wales when a young man, and settled
in London, where he practised as a surgeon for half a century
with very considerable success; but feeling the infirmities of age
coming on, he disposed of his business and withdrew into private
life. From his youth up he had maintained a good report amongst
his Christian brethren. He lived for years after he had relinquished
his practice, but latterly fell into such a state of apathy that he was
unable to recollect his own children, and had even forgotten the
English language, which he had spoken for more than fifty years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
using, in his Scripture quotations and audible prayers, his native
Welsh. He would remain for many hours in succession without
appearing to notice any visible object, asking any question, or replying
to any observation relating to secular matters. He had
withdrawn from the world, living surrounded with invisible realities,
the varying aspect of his countenance indicating some active
process of thinking and emotion; but when he heard the name of
Jesus mentioned, or any allusion to his love in dying for sinners,
his eyes would sparkle with peculiar radiance, his hands would clasp
together, and he would pour forth expressions of gratitude and joy,
which betokened the vital energy of his soul, and the intense interest
he felt in anticipation of the grand crisis. On his favourite theme
of meditation he evinced no dulness, nor lack of mental energy;
he would emerge from his seclusion to hold intelligible intercourse
with his Christian brethren, when he heard them give utterance to
the joyful sound, and then drew back, without any distinct recognition
of their persons, to dwell alone in the pavilion of the Divine
presence."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>"These are spiritual phenomena," said the Rev. Mr. Roscoe,
"which, like the phenomena of nature, are too plain and palpable
to be denied, even though it may not be in our power to give all
the explanations about the causes of them which our curiosity would
like to receive."</p>

GEORGE III. AND THE DYING GIPSY.</p>

<p>Vol. ii. p. 7.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Very true, Sir," said Mr. Ingleby; "but there are certain statements
and expressions in the New Testament which throw light
enough upon such phenomena to demonstrate that they have their
<em>natural causes</em>, and thus they are rescued from the supposition that
they are self-originated and self-sustained movements of the human
spirit, in some complexed and eccentric condition of existence. Our
Lord says to his disciples, 'I am the vine, ye are the branches; he
that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
fruit' (John xv. 5). The life of the branch depends on its adhesion
to the tree which supplies the sap of nourishment. Again, he says,
'I in them' (John xvii. 23). The apostle says, 'I live, yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me' (Gal. ii. 20). Again, 'Your life is hid with
Christ in God' (Col. iii. 3), denoting its invulnerable security. From
the passages which I have now quoted, and there are many others
of the same import, we arrive at this conclusion, which is an explanation
and a defence of the spiritual phenomenon, that there is
an actual, though inexplicable inhabitation of Jesus Christ in the soul
of a believer (Rev. iii. 20), sustaining the spiritual life within him,
as the vine nourishes the branch which bears its own fruit. And
as He has life in <em>himself</em>, he can do this with perfect ease, not only
when the believer is in vigorous health, and in the full exercise of all
his mental faculties, but when he is labouring under those physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
diseases and mental infirmities which, by a slow progression, lead to
his decay and death."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Guion observed, "That to deny the existence of
such phenomena, and others which bear some affinity to them,
simply because they are extraordinary, would be an act of absurdity
which no spiritual or even philosophic mind would venture to defend,
because the evidence in proof of their actual occurrence is so
clear and conclusive. The real question of difficulty to decide is
simply this:&mdash;Are they supernatural manifestations, or illusions of
the imagination? but, in either case, they go off into their own element
of mysteriousness, compelling us to believe what we cannot
explain. On a supposition that they are real manifestations of Divine
power and love, which I fully believe they are, I cannot help thinking
that the highly-favoured spirit (Old Rachel, for example), while
in such a state of <em>lucid and active unconsciousness</em>, if I may use such
an expression, must exist in something like an intermediate position
between the material and immaterial world&mdash;dying off from one by
a very slow progression, and getting meet for the other by a similar
process; occasionally stepping back to give unmistakeable signs of
the continued possession of the faculties of thought and emotion,
and then retreating, as into a citadel standing near the dark frontier
of the invisible world, and into which its celestial rays sometimes
penetrate."</p>

<p>"In these cases of rare occurrence," said Mr. Roscoe, "it is the
soul of the spiritual man retreating from visible and audible fellowship
with his pious associates; but biography supplies us <em>with
another order of moral phenomena</em> equally inexplicable, yet equally
gratifying, tending to confirm the reality of the connection between
the visible and invisible world which the Christian revelation so
plainly and positively announces. I received, some time ago, the
following statement from an elder of a Scotch church, on whose
testimony I can place implicit dependence:&mdash;'About the month of
August, 1838, I went to see my grandfather, a pious old man, ninety-two
years of age. I sat by his bedside, and others also were with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
him. He had been silent and motionless for about five hours, when
he opened his eyes, his countenance beaming with joy, and raising
his hands he said, I see heaven open, and Jesus Christ at the right
hand of God, and the angels of God descending to receive me. These
were his last words, and when he had given utterance to them he
expired.'"</p>

<p>"This reminds me," said Mr. Lewellin, "of an incident which occurred
at Stepney College,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> not long ago. When Ebenezer Birrel, a
student there, was dying, he requested all who were in the room with
him to keep silence. He also was silent and motionless. At length
he looked and gazed in rapture on some glorious object, which to him
alone was visible, exclaiming, as he gazed, '<em>Beautiful! beautiful!</em>' and
in uttering the word '<small>GLORY!</small>' his head fell and he expired."</p>

<p>"The case of Dr. Gordon, of Hull," said the Rev. Mr. Guion, "differing,
as it does in some particulars, from all the specimens we have
had of these spiritual phenomena, is, I think, deserving of our special
notice. 'He appeared,' says his biographer, 'just as he was expiring,
no longer conscious of what took place around him. He gazed
upwards, as in wrapt vision. No film overspread his eyes. They
beamed with an unwonted lustre, and the whole countenance, losing
the aspect of disease and pain, with which we had been so long familiar,
glowed with an expression of indescribable rapture. As we
watched, in silent wonder and praise, his features, which had become
motionless, suddenly yielded for a few seconds to a smile of ecstasy
which no pencil could ever depict, and which none who witnessed
it can ever forget. And when it passed away, still the whole countenance
continued to beam and brighten, as if reflecting the glory
on which the soul was gazing. This glorious spectacle continued for
about a quarter of an hour, increasing in interest to the last.'"</p>

<p>"I have heard of other cases," remarked Mr. Ingleby, "bearing
a strong resemblance to some which have been mentioned; but I
have never made much use of them, except as supplementary proofs
in confirmation of my own belief in the inseparable connection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the two worlds. They are not absolutely necessary to establish this
great fact; yet we must all admit, that such proofs <em>can be supplied</em>,
if it should please God to do so; and we know he has done it more
than once. Not to dwell on the vision of the apostle Paul, I would
just advert to the case of Stephen. When his enemies were gnashing
on him with their teeth, expressive of their indignation against
him, for accusing them of having betrayed and murdered the <span class="smcap">Just
One</span>&mdash;'He, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly
into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the
right hand of God' (Acts vii. 55). He saw clearly what the others
saw not, and for reporting what he saw he was denounced a blasphemer,
and was led out and stoned to death. This case settles two
great facts:&mdash;First, that God can, when he pleases, unveil to mortal
vision the glorious forms and appearances of the invisible world;
and secondly, that he has done it."</p>

<p>"I feel unwilling," said the Rev. Mr. Roscoe, "to object to any
evidence which tends to confirm our belief in the connection between
the visible and invisible world; but I think great caution is necessary
in employing such cases as have now been reported in proof
of it. What the old Scotchman and the youthful student saw, or
thought they saw, may, after all, have been nothing more than the
illusions of their own disturbed imagination, left at the closing scene
uncontrolled by the immortal spirit itself, while in the act of passing
from its material tabernacle, and away from its material senses,
into another, a higher, and more congenial economy of existence."</p>

<p>"True, Sir," said Mr. Ingleby; "but then, if we admit that they
really are illusions, we must also admit that they are illusive only
by a <em>forestalling process</em>; the imagination bringing to the senses, yet
bounded by the material economy, objects of vision belonging to
another state of existence&mdash;framing types of invisible realities&mdash;lifting
up, in the living temple of humanity, prefigurations of what
will be seen when the fulness of time comes for the disembodying
of the soul and its glorification. The illusion then relates, not to
the <small>UNREALITY</small> of <em>what is seen</em> and <em>felt</em>, but to the <em>unreality</em> of the <em>act</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of <em>vision</em>, and its <em>consequent excitement</em> and <em>impression, both mental
and physical</em>."</p>

<p>"We know," said. Mr. Roscoe, "that God very rarely deviates
in his providential administration, from the established laws of his
government; but we also know that he does sometimes, and for the
purpose of making us know more impressively that he is the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
who exercises loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the
earth, for in these things he delights. Hence, there have been two
translations from earth to heaven, without the intervening infliction
of death, but only two, since the fall of man. In reference to the remarkable
cases under consideration, there may be some difficulty in
deciding whether the persons actually saw what they are reported to
have seen, or were imposed on by the mysterious action of their own
imagination; but yet I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion, that
the visions were positive illusions, and that the happy spirits who
saw them, and spake of them, and whose radiant countenances betokened
the truthfulness of their testimony, were dying under the
spell of self-deception. Such cases, we know, but very rarely occur,
and when they do occur they make their appearance quite unexpectedly;
but I think they occur often enough, and with such varying
peculiarities, as to make us hesitate to pronounce them positive
illusions, even if we cannot admit with confidence that they are positive
realities."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Mrs. John Roscoe, "the spell of self-deception,
if they were deceived, was soon broken, as in each case death came
immediately after they uttered their last joyous exclamation; and
then the sublime vision of immortality opened upon them, with all
its glorious realities."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Guion here remarked that, "in general, the Lord's
people die in hope and with great calmness; and sometimes they rise
to confidence, and even to joy, and joy unspeakable. Few, indeed,
rise higher than this; but I have known enough, and heard enough,
to satisfy me that some do. The case of Dr. Gordon, who uttered no
exclamation, is to me a decisive proof of this. He is calm, motionless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wrapped in profound thoughts, when his countenance, which
had long been marked by the lines of disease and pain, begins to
radiate, till at length its lustre was so clear and bright, attended
by an ecstatic smile so ethereal, that the spectators were awe-struck,
standing and gazing for the space of a quarter of an hour on this
more than human vision. At least, they thought it more than
human while they were gazing on it."</p>

<p>"Every effect," said Mr. Ingleby, "must have some adequate
cause; and this extraordinary radiation on the countenance of Dr.
Gordon was produced either by the action of his own thoughts, or
by the intervention of a supernatural power. If produced by his
own thoughts, what a hold must his soul have taken of invisible
realities when he was dying, to give such a glowing brilliancy to
his pallid face! If produced by the intervening action of supernatural
power, it was a premature shining forth of the glory to
be revealed more fully in the disembodied state. In other words,
he did what was done by the impulse of his <em>own</em> conceptions, or
God was especially with him in his dying chamber, shedding upon
him some effulgent rays of his own glory."</p>

<p>"But to return," said the Rev. Mr. Roscoe, "to the case of Rachel,
the old blind woman, which, because it is capable of a more practical
bearing, I must confess, interests me more than the splendid
case of Dr. Gordon, interesting as it is. But, before I touch on
this, will you permit me to ask how long she lived after your unexpected
interview with her? and whether there was a recurrence of
the astonishing responses to your inquiries?"</p>

<p>"I sat gazing on her," said the Rev. Mr. Ingleby, "some time
after I ceased speaking; and before I left her, her countenance had
resumed its statue-like appearance of positive insensibility; and
every feature was fixed, as though set by the cold hand of death,
and there was not a movement of any part of her body, except the
breast and the shoulders, from the more powerful action of the lungs.
The following week I took a friend with me, in expectation of having
another interview with her; but I was disappointed. On entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the cottage, her daughter informed me, that having awoke in the
night, and thinking she heard her mother utter some sound, she
went with a light to her bedside, when the old woman, after a
slight convulsive struggle, raised her hands, and said, '<em>Dear Saviour,
I come to thee</em>,' and died."</p>

<p>"What a splendid transition!" said Mrs. Stevens; "the cottage
exchanged for a mansion! What a glorious sequel to all her privations
and sufferings! Her happy spirit, long confined in total
darkness, is at last liberated, and is now beholding the glory of
Christ, and living and moving amidst the celestial beings and sublime
grandeur of immortality."</p>

<p>"And yet we are told," said Mr. Roscoe, "that the faith of Christ,
which unveils such grand prospects of a future state of existence, is
a mere delusion, and that we who indulge them are self-deceived.
If we admit this, we must also admit that it is a very remarkable
delusion, as it usually comes in its most vivid forms, and with its
most attractive influences, just at that period of human existence
when all things of earth and of time are vanishing away. At that
awful crisis, when the pomp of distinction, the fascination of sensible
objects, and the grandeur of wealth, are all losing their hold on us&mdash;and
nothing is left to man but the shroud, the coffin, and the grave
&mdash;at that very time the Christian faith opens up a scene of grandeur
which no words can adequately describe; and yet the dying
man, who feels his departing spirit embracing these revelations as
sublime realities, is told by the cold-hearted sceptic that all is a delusion,
and he is self-deceived. But he heeds not such random assertions.
He moves forward, repeating the soul-inspiring words, 'Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
me' (Psal. xxiii. 4)."</p>

<p>"But this case of poor Old Rachel," said the Rev. Mr. Roscoe, "does
something more than exhibit the efficacy of the Christian faith, in
sustaining the human soul when the <em>dread hour comes</em>&mdash;it supplies a
proof of the immateriality, and, by a fair inference, of the immortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the soul itself. We are told, by some sagacious sceptics, that
the mind of man, like his body, is material, only that it has passed
through a more refined process, and is endowed <em>by nature</em> with certain
faculties analogous to the senses; and as they came into existence
together at the time of his birth, and live together through life, so
they will go out of existence together when they pay the debt of
nature, and, at last, perish together. And I must confess that humanity
has, in some instances, seemed to give a confirmation to this
opinion, as the body and the mind have appeared to wither and decay
together, as age and infirmities have come upon them. Hence there
has been a loss of memory with the loss of animal vivacity&mdash;a loss of
intellectual vigour with the loss of physical strength&mdash;a loss of imaginative
power with the loss of sensitive acuteness&mdash;the mind and
the body undergoing this reciprocal decay before the change comes
which, according to the sceptic's theory, is to end in their extinction.
But, then, I have met with another class of cases bearing some analogy
to this reciprocal decay, but, at the same time, putting forth indications
in confirmation of a reversed issue, as in the history of Old
Rachel. In her we see the memory losing the impression of earthly
objects, but retaining the impression of heavenly ones. Her intellect
lies prostrate and powerless in the presence of sensuous and
secular inquiries, but it springs into vigorous activity when spiritual
ones are addressed to her. The affections of her heart have
died off from the relationships of life; but they are concentrated on
the perfection of moral beauty, and cleave to Jesus Christ with an
intensity and ardour surpassing that of a youthful passion. Here
we have a living exponent, and a confirmation of the truthfulness of
the apostolic expression, 'Though our outward man perish, yet the
inward man is renewed day by day.' (See John xi. 25, 26)."</p>

<p>"And there is another practical lesson," Mr. Ingleby remarked,
"which this case of Old Rachel teaches us, and it is this:&mdash;When
a man is enlightened by the Spirit, and is brought into fellowship
with Jesus Christ, and has felt the power of the world to come, he
never outlives his knowledge of these wondrous realities which stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
out in bold relief when his remembrance of all other things is
blotted out. He may forget the wife of his bosom, and the children
who revered and loved him&mdash;he may forget his mother tongue, and
not recognize the hand which feeds and clothes him&mdash;and he may
live till almost every sense has become extinct, and the avenues of
communication between the imprisoned spirit and the living world
are blocked up&mdash;but he will never forget by whose blood he has been
redeemed&mdash;he will never become insensible to the charm of His
name or the preciousness of His love&mdash;nor will he ever lose sight of
the bright and unfading inheritance of which he has received the
earnest. Old Rachel was living at ease, conscious of her possessions,
even when, in the estimation of others, she was unconscious
of her own existence; and indulging the sublimest anticipations of
faith and hope, while in the dark cell of her confinement."</p>

<p>"Without giving any opinion," said the Rev. Mr. Roscoe, "as to
which of the cases reported this evening is the most remarkable, or
presuming to decide, whether they are to be referred to some mysterious
action of the imagination, or to a real, yet marvellous manifestation
of the Divine presence&mdash;leaving each case to stand for
your decision on the ground of its own merits&mdash;I think we may
make a good practical use of the whole of them, as, when we see
lights burning, though of varying degrees of brightness, we may
avail ourselves of their radiance even if we cannot tell by whom
they are enkindled. We believe that the evidence which the Bible
supplies, in confirmation of the existence of another world, is sufficiently
ample and decisive to satisfy us of its reality; but still it is
not so ample and decisive as to preclude the desirableness of some
additional evidence. This is often given in the death-chamber of
the Christian believer; and not only to him, when dying, but to
those who are eye-witnesses of the mode of his departure. When,
for example, we see a man of intelligence, of taste, of great sobriety
of thinking, and of courteous speech, quite calm on his death-bed,
and alternately strongly excited&mdash;when we hear him speak of the
hope he entertains of a glorious immortality&mdash;when we see him rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
above hope into full assurance, eager to depart, though surrounded
by many of the attractions of earth&mdash;when every look, and aspiration,
and utterance, beats in harmony with his long-settled expectation
of a grand issue to his faith&mdash;we may very naturally take his experience,
not only as a safe guide, but as a valid testimony to the certainty
of what we believe in common. But now suppose, if, in addition
to this tranquil state of mind, we should see a bright radiance
beaming on the countenance of our dying friend, previously pallid
and careworn by disease&mdash;and suppose we should see him raise himself
up in bed, looking intently, as if seeing some beautiful object
concealed from us, and, after a profound silence and stillness of some
minutes, we should hear him speak of actually seeing, while in the
body, what we believe he will see the moment he is out of the body&mdash;would
not this tend to strengthen our faith, even though we are
unable to decide whether he actually saw, or merely thought he
saw, the scenes he described? I think it would; and that even the
most dubious on the question of illusion or reality would retire from
such a hallowed spectacle, filled with emotions of deep solemnity
and joyous delight, similar to what a primitive believer must have
felt when looking on the face of Stephen, shining with angelic brilliancy,
a visible attestation of the reality of his miraculous vision."</p>

<p>"I think so too," said the Rev. Mr. Guion. "I should like to
witness such a sight and hear such an exclamation; and though I
will admit that such things may be nothing more than the illusive
action of the imagination, yet how comes the imagination, when
performing its very last operations, to act with so much power, as to
imprint such a visible radiance on a death-struck countenance? I
cannot resist the impression that such cases as Old Rachel's and Dr.
Gordon's, belonging certainly to a diverse order of spiritual phenomena,
are real manifestations of the glory and love of God, and are
intended by him, like the translation of Enoch and Elijah, as supplementary
evidence to confirm the faith, and animate the hope of
his redeemed and beloved children. At any rate, such is the effect
they have on me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"They have the same effect on my mind," said Mr. Ingleby; "especially
this case of poor Old Rachel, which will retain its power
of impression as long as I exist. I shall never forget the last interview
I had with her, nor her death-like appearance when I left her;
but when I see her again&mdash;and I trust to see her ere long&mdash;she will
appear in a beauteous form, arrayed in the spotless robe of celestial
glory. We know that our latter end is coming, but we know not <em>when</em>
it will come, or who of the living will be with us when it does come;
nor do we know whether we shall pass away, like Dr. Gordon, while
beams of glory are radiating our countenance, or steal out of life like
poor Old Rachel, as from under a pile of material ruins; but, for our
consolation, we know that our dear Redeemer has promised that <em>He</em>
will come to receive us to himself when we depart hence, and that
where he is we shall be also, and for ever: 'Wherefore, comfort one
another with these words' (1 Thess. iv. 18)."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>DIVERSITY OF OPINION VERY NATURAL.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="O" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">One morning, while Mrs. Stevens was conversing with
Mrs. John Roscoe, a girl who had been attending Mrs.
Stevens' Sabbath-school, and who was going into service,
called at Fairmount for a Bible which had been
awarded to her for her diligence and propriety of behaviour. After
expressing her thanks on receiving it, she added, in a very modest
tone, "I shall value it for your sake, Ma'am, and I hope I shall love
it for its own sake."</p>
</div>

<p>"I was very much pleased," said Mrs. John Roscoe, "with the
appearance and manners of your young protegÃ©. The reason she
gave for loving the Bible is a proof of superior intelligence, and, I
should hope, of decided piety."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she is an amiable girl, and I hope she is pious. She is a
<em>rescue</em> from a godless family. Her parents are very profane persons,
and their other children are following their example. I have no
doubt of her attachment to the Bible, for she has made herself very
conversant with it."</p>

<p>In the evening, when a few friends were assembled, Mrs. John
Roscoe mentioned how much pleased she had been with the Sabbath-school
girl, and repeated the remark she made on receiving the Bible
from Mrs. Stevens.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">For its own sake</span>," said the Rev. Mr. Guion; "that is a substantially
good reason for loving the Bible. It is a somewhat singular
fact that no book, on any subject or in any language, has so
completely divided public belief and sympathy, both on the question
of its origin and its practical utility."</p>

<p>"It certainly," Mr. Roscoe replied, "is a very singular, and a very
wonderful book: wonderful, if true; more so, if false. If true, we
can account for its origin; but how can its origin be accounted for
if it be false? If false, it is an invention; and not the invention of
one man, but of an organized conspiracy, and a conspiracy of good
men, for the Bible is too good a book for bad men to write."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"I admit that a bad man may write a good book;
but to suppose that a number of bad men would conspire to write
such a good book as the Bible, is to admit as great a moral impossibility
as to imagine that a number of good men would form a confederacy
in fraud and duplicity, and then palm off their lying
inventions as positive realities. Now, let us look at the case fairly,
and I think we may make some logical progress in settling the question
of its origin. Here is a Bible, and it consists of two parts&mdash;the
Old and the New Testament; and we must recollect that the
Old Testament would be incomplete without the New, and the New
Testament would be incomplete without the Old. Each of these
parts consists of different books, or distinct writings, variously
designated, occupying the space of nearly 2000 years in the composition
of them. If the Bible had been written by any one man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
any one age, or if it had been written by contemporary writers living
in the same city or country, its integrity might be open to very
strong suspicion. But the writers of the Bible lived in different
ages and in different countries, spoke different languages, belonged
to very different ranks in social life, and most of them were
unknown to each other; and yet there is, on all the facts and doctrines,
and institutes of these records, an exact concurrence<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of testimony
running through the whole of their writings. Amongst the
writers we find legislators, kings, poets, herdsmen, fishermen; one
was a publican, and another a tent-maker, who, at one period of his
life, denounced as false some of the facts of its record, which, on
investigation, he found to be true, and attested the integrity of
his new-formed belief by yielding to a martyr's death. And it will
be at once perceived by the intelligent reader, that these men were
no common-place writers; they moved in no beaten pathway of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
general knowledge; they are no copyists&mdash;they are originals; what
they tell us no other men had ever thought of, or, if they had, their
thoughts died with them, as they never gave publicity to them.
The writers of the Bible appear amongst us as scribes coming from
another world, well instructed in the mysteries of a unique faith,
admirably adapted to the peculiar exigencies of disordered and perplexed
humanity. In addition to the origin of the world and of evil&mdash;the
mediatorial work and government of the Son of God, the
moral character and condition, and responsibilities, and final destiny
of the soul of man&mdash;and a future economy of existence to last for
ever&mdash;are the momentous truths which they make known to us,
through the media of their multifarious and diversified compositions;
of history, prophecy, parable, poetic songs, and plain didactic
prose."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"And what is especially deserving of our
attention, is the perfect ease and harmony with which they write
on these new and sublime discoveries of moral truth, while they all
write independently of each other. They admit that they are subordinates,
unworthy of the honour of their appointment; yet each one
speaks and writes, and without any appearance of dogmatism or
ostentation, in the same dignified tone of absolute authority; the
voice which speaks and the hand which writes, is human, but what
is said or written, comes from some other source."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir, I think the correctness of your remark
can be demonstrated; at least, it comes as much within the
range of demonstration, as any moral or historic truth, or fact, can
be brought. The Old Testament is incomplete, and comparatively
valueless, without the New; and yet it is written under the obvious
impression and belief, that it would be completed; but on what data
could its writers base their calculation, that they should have successors
who would carry on and perfect what they had begun and
advanced through several stages of its progress. Now, I readily
believe, that a person of a very acute and comprehensive mind, who
has carefully watched and studied the facts and philosophy of history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
may, on some special occasions, give some general outline of
what will be the state of things within a very <em>near</em> futurity, if he
cautiously avoid going into specific and minute details. But the
writers of the Old Testament have opened up the roll of a <em>very remote</em>
futurity,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and have recorded extraordinary events, with their
dates and localities, long before their actual occurrence, portraying
the likeness of <span class="smcap">Messiah</span> the <span class="smcap">Prince</span>, ages before his appearance on
earth, and doing it with so much exactness, that it is a perfect
resemblance of the wonderful original. How could they have done
this, unless they had been guided by a prescient Spirit, to whose eye
all the future is as visible as all the past?"</p>

<p>"Foretelling at the same time," said Mrs. John Roscoe, "his tragical
death; which no one would have expected as the termination
of his benevolent career."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"It is, I believe, a law in the republic of letters,
which no one has attempted to repeal, that all writers shall have
the right of giving, if they please, their authorities for what they
say; and of letting us know from what source they derive the information
which they supply to us. Hence, no one can reasonably
object to let the writers of the Bible have the protection of this law,
which is of universal application. And what do they say on the
question relating to the source of their knowledge? We will take
their answer, and then form our own judgment of its integrity from
the facts and evidences of the case. "All Scripture is given by inspiration
of God:<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> holy men of God spake as they were moved by
the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This is a concise statement of their testimony
on this great question; and its integrity is fairly sustained by
positive and incidental evidence. We see that they have given
proofs of foreknowledge which far surpasses the capabilities of the
most acute and comprehensive human mind; while, at the same
time, they have made known to us a connected series of moral and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
spiritual truths, to which no other writers make any allusion, and of
which they could have formed no conception, unless they had been
under superhuman tuition. What they have done, is its own defence
against the imputation of fraud and dishonesty&mdash;standing as an imperishable
memorial of the love of God to man; and of the fidelity of
his servants, in disclaiming the honour of inventing a theory of
faith and morals which justly claims a Divine origin. This view of
the case, which is their own explanation, settles the question, without
requiring us to believe physical impossibilities, or compelling us to
reject the unrepealable law of moral evidence."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"And we may, I think, very properly regard the great
<em>moral power</em> of the Bible as a very telling collateral argument in favour
of its Divine origin. You may take any other book, on any other
subject, and put it into circulation amongst a mass of people, either
semi-barbarians or highly-polished citizens, but it will work no beneficial
changes in the general aspect of their moral character. It will
leave them, as it finds them. If it finds them, as in India, bowing down
and doing homage to stocks and stones, it leaves them worshipping
the workmanship of their own hands&mdash;still revelling in their cruel
and obscene abominations. If it finds them, as in Rome, kissing the
crucifix&mdash;offering up their adorations and orisons to the Virgin Mary&mdash;or
visiting the tomb of a real or legendary saint, in expectation of
some miraculous healing, it leaves them practising these puerile and
senseless exercises. If it finds them, as in Russia, crouching in terror
before the great Tyrant, doing his biddings like beasts of burden,
it leaves them in this prostrate state of degradation and misery.
But put the Bible into circulation amongst the same class of people,
and, after a while, you will perceive that it is taking effect upon
them. One reads it, and feels its moral power on his conscience and
his heart; another reads it, and he is subdued by its authority;
others read it and the same result follows: they are drawn together
by the attractive power which emanates from it, and become the
nucleus of a new order of human beings springing up in the midst of
the unchanged natives of the place. They are of the same ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
origin, and follow the same civil and social avocations and professions;
but they are a peculiar people, resembling the primitive
believers of the New Testament in intelligence and daring courage.
They are new creatures in Christ Jesus; and, in process of time, as
they increase in number and consequent activity, they give a new
tone and energy to the moral, the political, and the religious sentiments
and feelings of an entire community. It is to the Bible that
Scotland is indebted for her moral greatness; and England never
would have risen to her present eminence had it not been for the old
Puritans, who were animated and sustained by the examples, and
principles, and spirit of the Bible, in their passive sufferings and
active exertions in resisting the encroachments and the cruelties of
tyranny and oppression."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Your argument, Sir, is a legitimate one, and
it is as logical, as it is historically true. The book which effects the
changes which are essential to the happiness and well-being of men
as individuals, or men living in a community, but which cannot be
effected by the wit or eloquence of man, may fairly put in a claim to
a higher and a purer origin than mere humanity."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Stevens.</em>&mdash;"Unbelievers, in general, do not trouble themselves
to account for the origin of the Bible; they take for granted that it
is a book of mysticism and fraud, and at once direct their virulence
against it, and hold it up to scorn and contempt."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"And yet, notwithstanding all these attacks
on the Bible, it still lives and commands attention. In the
estimation of wise and good men, it takes precedence of all other
books: they not only admire, but revere and love it. I have in my
parish a good old man who has a large library, and has been a great
reader for upwards of twenty years, but now he very rarely reads
any book except his Bible. On referring, one day, to his devoted
attachment to the Bible, he said&mdash;'I feel, when reading it, in the
presence of God, and what I read comes with authority and power.
The more I read it the more is my attention fixed on another world,
and the more intensely do I desire to depart hence. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
mean and comfortless place of residence when compared with the
mansion our Lord is preparing for us in his Father's house.'"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Pious people are very fond of the Bible, and
their attachment to it increases as they advance in years; their
passion for it is often very strong in death."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Stevens.</em>&mdash;"Your remark, Sir, recalls to my remembrance what
passed, the other day, in a casual conversation between an intelligent,
yet very candid sceptic, and myself. 'There is,' he said, 'one phenomenon
connected with the Bible which has long puzzled me to account
for; if you can solve it, I shall feel obliged. I have noticed
wherever I have been&mdash;and I have travelled through Europe and
America&mdash;I have visited India and some of the islands of the South
Seas, and resided for awhile amongst the black population of the West
Indies&mdash;and whenever I have met with any persons who believe in
the truth of the Bible, whether they were refined and intelligent or
the reverse, they uniformly evinced for it the same profound reverence
and supreme attachment.' 'The solution,' I replied, 'is easily
given. They revere it as their statute-book, containing the code of
laws which their Divine Legislator has issued to test their obedience
to his authority; and they love it, as bringing life and immortality to
light; making known to them a Saviour who is able and willing to
save them from the wrath to come, and to give them peace of soul
as an earnest and a pledge of future and eternal happiness; and they
value it for its exceeding great and precious promises, which have a
soothing and sustaining influence over their hearts in the times of
their sorrows and afflictions.' 'But how is it,' he added, 'that while
they cherish such a profound reverence for the Bible, they differ so
widely in the interpretation they put on its meaning? How will
you account for this rather puzzling fact?' The sudden entrance of
several strangers into the room prevented me from making a reply."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"This difference of interpretation, which sceptics
often bring forward as a plausible argument against the Divine
origin of the Bible, very frequently perplexes conscientious believers.
I recently received a letter from a gentleman who says&mdash;'When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
think of the sentiments which are held by different bodies of Christians&mdash;sentiments
which are directly opposed to each other, and
which appear to me to admit of no adjustment; and when I recollect
that they all profess to derive them from the same source,
and are in the habit of appealing to the same authority in support
of them&mdash;I feel myself approaching a difficulty which I know not
how to solve. Is the Bible really such a mysterious book that it is
incapable of being understood? Is it an oracle which utters truth
and falsehood? If so, it cannot be a safe guide; and if it be not so,
how do you account for the very different interpretations which it
receives?'"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Stevens.</em>&mdash;"How did you meet the difficulties of the case?"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"I did not go fully into the question, because
I knew, from the cast of his mind, that he would work himself right.
I merely stated that conflicting opinions do not, of themselves, possess
sufficient weight to set aside any law, or destroy the truth of
any proposition which comes attested by its own proper evidence.
And to give force to this very obvious truism, I reminded him of
our judges, who sometimes give different interpretations of a statute
law, without impairing its authority; and of our philosophers, whose
different opinions on the primary cause of motion, do not disturb
popular belief in the diurnal revolution of our earth. But, after all,
we do not differ in our interpretations of the Bible so much as many
imagine. It is true there are separate and distinct denominations of
Christians, who are regarded by the ignorant and bigoted as the
disciples and abettors of very opposite religious creeds; yet if we inquire
into the actual state of the case, we shall find that most of
them agree in all that is essential and vitally important in the
Christian scheme, and that they differ only on what is subordinate,
and comparatively unimportant."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"It is supposed by many that this diversity of
interpretation which is given to some parts of the Bible would have
been prevented if a logical or systematic order had been scrupulously
observed. If, for example, the sacred writers had arranged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
facts, the doctrines, the precepts, the institutions, the sanctions, the
evidences, and the final recompense of the Christian faith, systematically&mdash;presenting
the whole in a compendious form&mdash;there would
be, in that case, so much compactness, such symmetrical order&mdash;one
part of the theory would hang so naturally on another&mdash;that it would
be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for any division of opinion
to spring up amongst us on the question of its import or design. We
should then think and believe alike. This is what I have heard
some speculatists say; but I have no confidence in the integrity of
their opinion."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"The objections against an inspired compendium
of Christian doctrine and practice, are, in my judgment,
more powerful than the arguments in favour of it. If we had it, we
should revere it, and learn it; it would perpetually recur to our recollection
in our reflective moments, and by rendering a studious
examination of the other parts of the Scripture unnecessary, we
should be liable to sink into 'a <em>contented apathy</em>' of spirit, under
this conviction, that as we can repeat all, we know all that is necessary
for us to know."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"Archbishop Whately, when alluding to this
subject, says, 'that if we had this compendium, both it and the
other parts of the Scriptures would be regarded as of Divine authority;
but the compendium itself would be looked upon by most as the
fused and purified metal; the other, as the mine containing the crude
ore. And the compendium itself, being, not like the existing Scriptures,
that <em>from which</em> the faith is to be learned, but <em>the very thing
to be learned</em>, would come to be regarded by most with an indolent,
unthinking veneration, which would exercise little or no influence
over them.'"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"Universal experience proves, that facility in obtaining
a supply to our physical necessities, is not so beneficial to the
energy and vigour of the human constitution, as difficulty, which
stimulates to labour and invention. Compare, for example, the
natives of the South Sea Islands, whose bread-fruit ripens of itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with the hardy Highlanders of Scotland, who have to toil for their
living through frost and snow, as well as sunshine&mdash;what a difference
in their muscular and masculine conformation and appearance. And
the same remark is equally applicable to the mind of man, whose
knowledge on any subject, in any department of science, and especially
the science of Biblical theology, is accurate and profound, in
proportion to the efforts he is obliged to make in its acquisition.
A compendium would be the bread-fruit, within reach, and easily
plucked. We should, if we had it, become dwarfs in Biblical theology.
It is only when our energies are roused by a love of the truth,
and stimulated by the difficulties connected with its attainment, that
our knowledge in the mystery of Christianity gets perfected, and becomes
practically powerful in its influence over the heart and the
character."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"And in addition to the relaxing influence
which a compendium would exert over the mind&mdash;indisposing it to
any labour in searching the Scriptures, except the labour of the
memory, and that to a very superficial extent&mdash;I have another
objection to such a projected scheme, which is this:&mdash;I do not think
it possible for the Christian faith to be reduced to such a compact,
or what you term compendious form, as shall secure amongst its
advocates and defenders a perfect unity of belief on all points, without
the perpetual exercise of a supernatural agency in the illumination
and guidance of the mind, which would amount to something
like a plenary inspiration to every believer. Now what can be more
logically explicit than the articles of our church; and yet what a
very different construction do different men put upon them!"</p>

<p><em>Mrs. John Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"That is true. If I were in a church on a
Sabbath morning listening to a Tractarian; if I returned in the
afternoon, and heard a Moderate; and if, in the evening, I occupied
the same pew, while an Evangelical was doing duty in the pulpit,
I should find myself in a modern Babel, witnessing, on a small scale,
a new specimen of the confusion of tongues."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"But this difference of opinion and diversity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
interpretation on the same theory of belief, prevails amongst others
as well as amongst us. Even amongst unbelievers, who almost deify
reason&mdash;asserting and maintaining, that it is fully equal to all the
exigencies of humanity, without being under any obligation to a
Divine inspiration&mdash;there is almost an endless diversity of belief and
opinion on all questions relating to God, to human responsibility,
and the final destiny of man. They are obliged to pass a toleration
act to live in peace."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"I like a toleration act; it is essential to our
peace. The period is coming when we shall <em>'see eye to eye</em>;' but that
will be under a dispensation very different to the present; we must
now agree to differ, and while contending earnestly for the faith once
delivered to the saints, we must live together as brethren."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"Jesus Christ said to his disciples&mdash;'These
things I command you, that ye love one another' (John xv. 17); and
he says the same things to us. And if we love one another, we
shall never vote for a repeal of our toleration act, which admits of
some shades of difference in our religious belief and opinions."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"It was doubted, a few years since, whether
even the spiritual members of our various denominations cherished
any fraternal esteem and affection for each other&mdash;they often acted
more like gladiators than brethren; but now they are cultivating a
spirit of union and peace."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"This change in their spirit and conduct is a very
gratifying and auspicious event; but some good men maintain that
the entire abolition of the distinctive denominations and their union
in one undivided body, would be more conducive to the honour of
Christianity, and more favourable to its progressive triumphs."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"This I conceive to be impracticable during
the partial obscurity of the present dispensation; and I must confess
that I do not think it advisable. I have no objection to those divisions
of opinion which separate us into different denominations,
though I deplore the spirit which they sometimes engender. I
think that a variation in belief, on some of the minor questions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
religion, by keeping our attention awake and active, tends to preserve
the more important truths in a purer state; and the action
and re-action of one Christian denomination on another, prevents
that stagnation of feeling, and that inertness of principle, which an
unbroken and undisturbed uniformity admits of."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"But, would not the church assume a more imposing
aspect, and put forth a more powerful energy, if she could unite all
her members in one undivided body, under the immediate authority
of one Head, than she does now, broken as she is, into so many
subdivisions?"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir, if she could preserve her purity
uncontaminated; but we ought never to forget, that while the religion
we profess is Divine in its origin, and indestructible in its
nature, it is human in its forms and administrations. Hence it
alternately displays resistless power and exhausted weakness&mdash;the
sanctity and grandeur of its Author, along with the infirmities and
imperfections of the agents to whom it is intrusted&mdash;sometimes
exciting the profound veneration of the multitude, and at other
times their contempt or indifference. And it is this admixture of
what is human with what is Divine, that renders it expedient that
there should be some exposure to the influence of that re-action of
distinctive opinions, and of social attachments, which, by keeping us
alive to <em>the purity and extension of our separate communions</em>, tends
to promote the purity and extension of the faith which we hold in
common."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Stevens.</em>&mdash;"Your opinion exactly accords with my own.
Hence, instead of regarding the Established Church, and the various
denominations of orthodox Dissenters, as hostile foes, aiming at each
other's humiliation and destruction, we should look on them as subjects
of the same monarch, each bearing the distinctive insignia of
his own order; yet mutually supporting each other without the
formality of a visible contact, and, as his sovereign will directs,
advancing, each in his own way, the work of reclaiming to a state of
allegiance the people who have revolted from his authority."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Or, to vary the figure, we may view them as
so many servants belonging to the same master, who are employed
in cultivating the great moral vineyard, whose reward at last will
be in proportion to their fidelity to him, and their affection for each
other. If this comparison be just, then, if we cherish a complacent
feeling exclusively for those who belong to our own class, and attempt
to lord it over our fellow-servants who may belong to another, or
treat them discourteously, we dishonour ourselves, and offend against
the law of our Lord, who has commanded us to love each other as
brethren."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"When I consider the fallibility of the human mind&mdash;the
prejudices of education&mdash;the influence of accidental reading
and associations&mdash;and the extensive prevalence of erroneous opinions,
instead of being astonished by the shades of difference which
prevail amongst us, I am surprised that we think so nearly alike.
We agree on the substantial facts, and doctrines, and institutes, and
precepts of revelation, while we differ on some of its forms and ceremonial
enactments. But these trifling differences, which do not
endanger the safety, nor add to the stability of our faith, ought not
to excite jealousy and suspicion, and cause alienation of affection, as
though we were avowed enemies. No. When this is the case we
give a decisive proof that we do not possess the spirit of the gospel;
or, if we possess it, we do not display it, which aggravates rather
than extenuates our sin."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"In the last prayer our Saviour uttered, just
before he presented himself the expiatory sacrifice for human guilt,
he earnestly entreated that all his disciples, in every future age,
might be one, even as he and his Father are one; and he assigns the
reason&mdash;<em>That the world may know that thou hast sent me.</em> For
some ages, the object of that prayer was realized in the harmony
which prevailed amongst Christians whose religion was a bond of
union more strict and tender than the ties of consanguinity; and
with the appellation of brethren they associated all the sentiments of
endearment that relation implied. To see men of the most contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
characters and habits&mdash;the learned and the rude&mdash;the most polished,
and the most uncultivated&mdash;the inhabitants of countries alienated
from each other by institutions the most repugnant, and by contests
the most violent&mdash;forgetting their ancient animosity, and blending
into one mass, at the command of a person whom they had never
seen, and who had ceased to be an inhabitant of this world, must
have been an astonishing spectacle. Such a sudden assimilation of
the most discordant materials; such love issuing from hearts the
most selfish, and giving birth to a new race and progeny, could be
ascribed to nothing but a Divine interposition; it was an experimental
proof of the commencement of that kingdom of God&mdash;that
celestial economy, by which the powers of the future world are imparted
to the present."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Stevens.</em>&mdash;"It must have been a spectacle no less delightful to
the eye of the Christian than astonishing to the unbeliever; and had
the visible church always exhibited such a spectacle of union and
affection, her history would have been the records of her spiritual
triumphs, rather than of her persecutions and her miseries. But her
bonds of union have been broken asunder, and her love of the brethren
has been quenched in the bitter waters of strife. We are the
descendants of the holy men who first caught, and first displayed the
spirit of the Prince of Peace, but how little do we resemble them!
We imbibe the same faith, plead the same promises, claim the same
privileges, participate in the same spiritual enjoyments, bear the
same distinctive and relative character, and anticipate the same
high destiny; but we too often act as though we were released from
the obligations which they admitted and discharged; and instead of
attempting to convince sceptics and unbelievers of the divinity of
our Lord's mission, and the moral efficacy of his death, by our union
and our reciprocal affection, we strengthen them in their infidelity
by our anti-Christian spirit. Can no remedy be devised to correct
this noxious evil, which, like a withering blight, tarnishes the
moral lustre of all our distinctive denominations, and does more to
embitter the spirit, and extend the triumphs of infidelity, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the most virulent works which issue from her corrupt and hostile
press?"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, I hope the evil is in some small
degree abated by the influence of our public institutions. Those
who, a few years since, were envious and jealous of each other, now
associate together on the most friendly terms. If the Bible Society
has not terminated the contest, it has been the means of concluding
a truce between them; and I flatter myself that there will be no
renewal of hostilities, even though some of the more bigoted belonging
to the different denominations should feel disposed to revive
them."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"I fear, Sir, you are rather too sanguine in your
expectations. In the little circle in which we move, in this isolated
spot of the religious world, the spirit of fraternal love and union is
cherished; but what commotion and strife prevail just now between
both the clerical and lay members of our own church!"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir, I know it and deplore it. It is the
spirit of dry formalism setting itself in array against the spirit of
vital Christianity; and the contest will be severe, but the issue is
certain&mdash;the Word of the Lord will prove more powerful than the
traditions of man."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Stevens.</em>&mdash;"I must confess that I am rather sanguine in my
calculations of the moral influence of the Bible Society on the best
and most active men of our age. Dr. Mason, of New York, says, in
the preface to a work which he has published&mdash;'Within a few years
there has been a manifest relaxation of sectarian rigour among the
different denominations in America, so that the spirit of the gospel,
in the culture of fraternal charity, has gained a visible and growing
ascendency. This happy alteration,' he adds, 'may be attributed, in
a great degree, to the influence of missionary and Bible societies.'"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"And it is so amongst us to some extent.
Till the Bible Society arose, and gained a settlement in our land, we
had not an inch of neutral ground on which we could assemble, and
unite with each other in any religious enterprise; but now we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the province of Goshen assigned us; and the air of that place is
so salubrious, the light so clear and brilliant, the atmosphere so temperate
and serene, and the harmony of its inhabitants so profound,
that we venerate it as the mystic inclosure in which we have an
emblematical representation of the celestial inheritance&mdash;in which
the spirits of the just live in closest union and sweetest concord.
May the catholicism of grace and truth wax stronger and stronger,
till Ephraim shall not envy Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim; the
strife of sect being overcome and banished by the all-subduing love of
God our Saviour!"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"And what is it but prejudice, arising from ignorance
and misconception, which prevents this cordial union and fraternal
attachment? No one, I am conscious, who understands the genius of
Christianity, or who has ever felt his bosom glow with supreme love
to the Redeemer, can for a single moment presume to recommend
disunion amongst the members of the household of faith, though they
may occupy different compartments, and commune at separate tables.
It is prejudice that kept me aloof from Dissenters, and made me unwilling
to associate with them; because I understood that the generality
of them rejected the essential doctrines of Christianity; but now
my error is corrected, I esteem them as my brethren in Christ;
and as I hope to meet them in heaven, and unite with them in the
sublime exercises of that holy place, I feel a pleasure in mingling
with them on earth."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"I have lived on terms of intimacy with many
who do not belong to the church of which I am a minister, and
some of the happiest moments of my life have been spent in social
and spiritual intercourse with them. Our conversation, when we
have been together, has not turned on the questions on which we
differ, but on those on which we agree; and I have often retired
from these interviews with my mind relieved from its cares, and
both animated and enriched by the interchange of devout sentiment
and feeling. And in looking forward to the final consummation, I
indulge a hope of partaking of much holy delight in associating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Luther and Calvin, with Fenelon and Claude, with Whitfield and
Wesley, with Hall, Foster and Chalmers, and other illustrious men,
of the same and other denominations, who have entered into rest.
I have lived in stormy times, but I have never increased the fury of
the tempest. I have seen the spirit of party raging with desolating
violence, and have known some of those, who have borne the image
of the heavenly, stand in opposing columns to each other in the
field of fierce and angry debate; but I have been enabled, through
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, to hold on my way unconnected
with their unhappy hostilities; and now it is with no common feelings
of gratitude and delight that I indulge the hope of leaving
the church and the world at a period when, if the temple of war
is not actually closed, yet our denominations are forming a more
correct estimate of each other's relative strength and importance, in
the conflict which we have to sustain against the combined powers
of superstition and infidelity; and this will necessarily tend to
increase our reciprocal esteem and confidence."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"If, in our intercourse with each other, we
always acted on your prudential maxim, of conversing on questions
of general agreement, rather than on controversial ones, the spirit
of discord would be exorcised from amongst us, and then we might,
I think, justly calculate on a more copious measure of the influences
of the Spirit poured down from on high, when we should intuitively
feel, by a force of evidence too powerful to be withstood, that <em>God is
love</em>, and that we never please him more than when we embrace, with
cordiality and esteem, all who bear his image, without distinction of
sect or party."</p>

and charity I now concur most heartily."</p>

<h2>UNION WITHOUT COMPROMISE</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The Rev. Mr. Ingleby, on resuming the discussion of the
question of union amongst the various denominations of
believers in the Divine origin of the faith of Christianity,
made the following very pertinent remarks:&mdash;"If it
were the will of God that the various denominations of Christians
should all think and act alike, as the tribes of Israel were required
to do under the Levitical dispensation, we should have laws laid
down for our guidance with the same minuteness and explicitness as
was done for them. But such is not the case. We have certain
general principles laid down, and the motives by which all our actions
should be governed set before us with clearness and precision, but
we have no particular directions as to the external form of church
government. We are therefore left free to adopt that ecclesiastical
system which, after careful examination, we find most in conformity
with the spirit of the New Testament."</p>
</div>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"You mean, Sir, I presume, that we are left free
to choose either the Episcopal, or Presbyterian, or Congregational
form of church government?"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir; and though I do not profess to be
deeply read in casuistry, yet I believe that very much may be collected
from the facts and incidents recorded in Scripture, and from
the casual expressions of the sacred writers in favour of each of these
forms of church government."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"And so I think. We are not living under a
law laid down with minute exactness, like the ancient tribes of
Israel, but have the right of exercising our choice on these matters
of church polity, and our choice is determined by preference or expediency,
or both. That is, I may deem it expedient to be an Episcopalian
in one country, or a Presbyterian in another, or a Congregationalist
in a third; and I may, at the same time, most decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
prefer one of these modes of church government to either of the
other, as being, in my opinion, the nearest approach to the teachings
of the New Testament. To adopt such a principle as this is, appears
to me more in harmony with the spirit of the New Testament
dispensation, than putting in a claim for the Divine right of Episcopacy,
or Presbyterianism, or Congregationalism; it is an equitable
concession to others of the liberty we claim for ourselves; and hence,
without being guilty of any degree of inconsistency, we can cultivate
Christian fellowship with our brethren of other denominations,
without compromising our own principles."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"You will still leave, I presume, as a question
open for discussion, the relative conformity of each mode of church
government to the New Testament model?"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"Most certainly; and when discussions go on,
untainted by the dogmatism and acrimony of party predilections
and antipathies, and are conducted in a liberal and loving spirit,
they tend to give solidity to the foundation on which our relative
union is based; and show, at the same time, that it can be cemented
and perpetuated without any dishonourable compromise."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Lewellin.</em>&mdash;"I was present in a company some time since,
when an ingenious Scotchman made out, as he thought, a very strong
claim for the superiority of Presbyterianism to the other forms of
church government. Episcopacy, he remarked, has the monarchical
element too dominant in her constitution&mdash;<em>the clergy are everything;</em>
in Congregationalism, the democratic element is too dominant&mdash;<em>the
people are everything</em>; but Presbyterianism unites the two elements,
and in about equal proportions <em>the clergy and the people act together</em>&mdash;they
are a combined power."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Ingenious, if not just. However, without
pausing to discuss this question, I think it is very plain that the
writers of the New Testament evince a much stronger predilection
for the facts and doctrines of the gospel than they do for its rites
and ceremonies&mdash;deeming the one essential to the integrity of the
faith, while the other is subordinate and non-essential; and I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
we cannot do better than imitate them; for after all, the forms
and ceremonies of church government are but as the chaff to the
wheat&mdash;the mere attire of a living personage, not the person himself.
I prefer Episcopacy to either of the other forms, though I will not
take upon myself the task of defending every appendage which has
been affixed to it; yet, with all my predilections in its favour, if the
pure faith of Christianity were ejected from an Episcopal pulpit, <em>as
it often is</em>, I would go and worship in a Congregational chapel; and
I have no doubt but a spiritually-enlightened Presbyterian would
rather listen to the glad tidings of salvation in one of our churches,
than to a merely moral sermon in one of his own. In my opinion,
the three distinct orders of churches may be planted on the same
soil, may grow in harmony side by side; and without any compromise
of principle, may co-operate with each other, in combined movements,
against either their Papal or sceptical opponents, and feel
also a high degree of joyous satisfaction in witnessing each other's
prosperity and honour."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"Yet I still prefer fellowship with our own church,
while cherishing fraternal esteem and fellowship with our Christian
brethren of other churches."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Certainly. When we say that the members
of our church, and the various orders of Dissenters who have
seceded from it, ought, in obedience to the authority of the Lord
Jesus Christ, to cherish reciprocal esteem, and live in peaceful harmony,
we do not mean that they are to separate themselves from
their own communions, or cease to give them a decided preference."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"In that view of the case I heartily concur; for
if the spirit of a comprehensive brotherly love and fellowship were
to lead to alienation from our distinctive denominations, it would
want one of the evidences of being a peace-maker&mdash;healing the
breaches which party spirit has unhappily made amongst us. As
a member of a family ought to feel a stronger regard, and take a
deeper interest in its prosperity and happiness, than he is expected
to cultivate towards the community at large, so I think the member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of any individual Christian church, may and ought to cherish
a greater affection for his brethren with whom he lives on more intimate
terms of fellowship than he does for his fellow-disciples in
general."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"You have, Sir, very clearly expressed the view I
now entertain of our relative obligations. We are to do good to all
when we have an opportunity, but more especially to those of the
household of faith with whom we are united in church fellowship&mdash;uniformly
endeavouring, by our prayers, our influence, our wealth,
and our sympathy, to promote their individual and collective prosperity
and happiness."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"You are now leading us from the sentimental
and ceremonial to the practical department of Christian obligation,
in which I think, from motives of gratitude to our Divine Master,
we ought all to be increasingly active, provoking one another unto
love and good works. This will be acting more in harmony with
our faith, and prove more beneficial to ourselves and others than a
rigid adherence to any sectarian form. When returning home the
other day from one of my pastoral visitations, I met a very poor
man, who had a severe affliction in his family, and he said rather
abruptly, 'I wish, Sir, you would give us a sermon from the words
of the apostle John, 'But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth
his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion
from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?' (1 John iii. 17).'
I was not surprised at this application, when I found that he had
just been to the Hall, the residence of a very wealthy professor of
religion, to ask some assistance for his distressed family, but had
received only a few words of vague sympathy and regret for his misfortunes."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Well may the apostle say&mdash;how dwelleth the
love of God in such a heart! But, alas, wealth too often proves a
curse to its possessor. How kindly and tenderly does the apostle
address us: 'My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
tongue, but in deed and in truth.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"Our Divine Master exhibits himself as the
model for our imitation; making, at the same time, our love for each
other the test of the genuineness of our Christian character: 'A new
commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have
loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know
that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another' (John xiii.
34, 35)."</p>

<p><em>Mrs. John Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"<em>As I have loved you!</em>&mdash;emphatic words, expressive
of the spirit we ought to cultivate towards all our Christian
brethren, especially the afflicted, and prescribing the rule for our
conduct towards them. If we imbibe this spirit and act upon it, we
shall then endeavour to cheer them with our sympathy in the hours
of their grief and mourning, and cheerfully draw from our worldly
resources to afford them relief when in want. I remember now an
anecdote told by the Rev. Mr. Jay:&mdash;A pious, but poor member of
his church being visited by one of the deacons, and presented with
five shillings as a church gift, with the remark, 'Here is a trifle for
your necessities,' replied, 'What you call a trifle, I call an estate.'"</p>

<p><em>Miss Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"I believe, dear uncle, that you now have in your
congregation an organized society, labouring to promote the physical
as well as the spiritual good of the needy and destitute."</p>

<p><em>Mrs. John Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"O yes, we are working the principle of
practical benevolence, and on the basis of a comprehensive union;
and I am happy to say it works well in spite of the grumblers
who would rather sleep on and take their rest than be roused to
action. The gentlemen take the management of the domiciliary
society, going from house to house with tracts, &amp;c., &amp;c., and the
ladies manage the Dorcas society, which is in a very flourishing
condition. In addition to a pretty large number of subscribers, we
have twenty working members who meet once a fortnight for the
purpose of making clothes for the poor. Some of these are persons
of wealth, others are in moderate circumstances; and, as in the gentlemen's
society, some are church people, and some are Dissenters,
you may there see sitting in peaceful harmony, members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
various denominations, all busily engaged in the same sort of labour,
and heartily prosecuting the same work."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"Then you have grumblers amongst you!"</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"Indeed, we have. They are a very prolific family&mdash;they
may be found everywhere, and the whole fraternity is distinguished
by a strong family likeness."</p>

<p><em>Miss Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"Do you give the clothes to the poor, or do you
sell them?"</p>

<p><em>Mrs. John Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"In general we sell what we make, yet very
much below the cost price; but in extreme cases we give clothing,
and, in addition to this, when any of those who require relief are ill,
we visit them, and we often find that a kind visit is esteemed as
much, if not more than our gratuities."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"I can easily believe that, because there is great
power in sympathy to alleviate the sorrows of the heart. We cannot
explain the action of moral power, nor conceive the mode of its
operation, however sensible we may be of its effects. What power,
for example, in a frown to depress! and in a smile to elevate and
tranquillize! What power in words both to cheer and sadden the
heart! <em>As I have loved you</em>&mdash;these expressive words should guide
our fraternal intercourse with our Christian brethren, who, when
they feel our sympathy to be real, will often attach a much greater
value to it than to any amount of pecuniary assistance."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"We are too apt to forget that our Christian brethren,
in common with ourselves, are children of one Father, and that we
are all now passing through a preparatory discipline to fit us for a
higher and purer condition of existence in another world. If these
great facts were more powerfully impressed on our hearts, there
would be more sympathy and more charity; the rich would cheerfully
administer to the wants of their poor brethren, and those who have
but little worldly substance to bestow, would more often soothe and
enliven them by their sympathy and good wishes. Christian fellowship
would then be more than a mere term&mdash;it would be a reality."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Your remarks, Sir, are quite correct. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
here we see the wisdom as well as the love of our Redeemer in
grafting our obligations to the most intimate Christian fellowship on
the very constitution of our nature, which inclines us to live in social
intercourse; guarding us at the same time from the danger of contracting
a sectarian spirit by enjoining on us the duty of doing good
<em>unto all men</em>, as well as to those who belong to the <em>household of faith</em>."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Lewellin.</em>&mdash;"It is to be lamented, Sir, that there are many
who do not keep pace in liberality of sentiment and feeling, and
generosity of disposition, with the denomination or church to which
they belong&mdash;they will not labour in the field of practical benevolence,
and they do not like to see others exerting themselves; in
fact, they will do nothing but find fault with the active labourers,
either impeaching the purity of their motives, or predicting the
failure, if not the pernicious results of their efforts. And when these
morbid grumblers happen to be imbued, as is often the case, with a
sectarian spirit, and take rank with high churchmen or with bigoted
Dissenters, the moment they see a conjunction of the different orders,
they tremble for the safety of the ark of <em>their</em> covenant, and raise a
hue and cry against the union of the sects&mdash;become bitter in their
spirit and censorious in their speech&mdash;and appear in a light very
unbecoming the genuine disciples of our Lord."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Such professors do essential injury, not only to
the honour of the church and denomination to which they belong,
but to the cause of religion in general. The evil which results from
the anti-Christian temper and spirit of these arrogant and censorious
professors, who usually contrive to attract more notice than the rest
of their fellow-members, is incalculable. It supplies infidels with
their most plausible topics of invective; it hardens the conscience of
the irreligious, weakens the hands of the good, and is probably the
principal obstruction to that ample effusion of the Holy Spirit which
is essential to the renovation of the world. If, then, we wish to make
any deep and permanent impression on the sceptical and irreligious&mdash;to
silence their objections and convince them of the Divine origin
of the faith which we profess&mdash;we must correct our tempers&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
must live in peace amongst ourselves, discover no disposition to
injure or annoy each other, and give unequivocal proof that the
questions on which we differ are the subordinate tenets of revelation,
which may be received or rejected without affecting its truth, or
impairing its strength; and, by a union of affection and concentration
of our talents, we must advance in the beautiful development
of our Christian life, remembering that the wisdom which
is from above is 'first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be
intreated; full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and
without hypocrisy.' When the pious members of the Establishment
and the various denominations of evangelical Dissenters are brought
to merge their speculative and ceremonial differences in the cultivation
and display of this Christian temper, the eulogium pronounced
on the primitive disciples may then with truth be applied to us&mdash;'See
how these Christians love one another!'"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"The novelty of the sight would certainly
command attention; and though I am fully persuaded that nothing
but a supernatural power can renovate the human heart, yet such a
display of united affection might have a wondrous effect, almost
approaching that of a miracle, in the conversion of the world."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"If it be true that our personal happiness bears
a proportion to our conformity to the spirit and temper of Jesus
Christ, it is evident that a liberal-minded Christian must partake of
a much larger share of enjoyment than one who lives under the
influence of that sectarian bigotry which keeps him in a state of
alienation from his brethren of other communions."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Stevens.</em>&mdash;"Most certainly, Sir; and by your permission I will
now read you a paragraph with which I was very forcibly struck
when I first lighted upon it. The author is speaking of bigotry, and
he says, 'This sectarian and intolerant spirit can view no excellence
out of its own pale, and deems every opinion heresy that does not
bow to its authority. Its plans of doing good always betray the selfishness
of their origin; and unable from its very nature to form designs
commensurate with the grandeur of religion and the necessities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
world, it not only refuses to co-operate with Christians of another
party in promoting the well-being of society and the advancement of
religion, but contemplates with jealousy and often with abhorrence,
the noblest efforts of benevolence, when not performed under its exclusive
auspices. Persons governed by such a spirit cannot view with
complacency the separate divisions of the universal church, though
there is nothing in their constitution that necessarily militates against
<em>the unity of the spirit</em> and <em>the bond of peace</em>. This unlovely bigotry narrows
the range of the intellect&mdash;perverts and contracts the best affections&mdash;and,
under its influence, even good men forget the charities
of their renewed nature, and sometimes prostitute their talents to
bear false witness against each other. To this bigotry, that religion,
whose very essence is love, is directly opposed. Christians who
imbibe the spirit of the New Testament, and who suffer that holy
book to operate with full force upon their minds, are distinguished
by a noble freedom from sectarian antipathies. They can say from
the heart, 'Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in
sincerity.' Without verging to the extreme of latitudinarian indifference,
they can rejoice in the success of parties different from
their own, and they do not complain because 'devils are cast out
by those who follow not with them.' Every man is a friend and
a brother who consecrates his being to the glory of the Saviour, and
every society a church in whose temple Jesus evidently records
his name.'"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir, I am conscious that a pious man, who
possesses the pure spirit of his religion, is at once the most useful
and the most happy man. As his happiness arises from sources more
refined than those to which the men of the world have access, his
usefulness is of a more important and more durable nature. I remember
an observation which was once made on a friend of my own,
when he withdrew from a select company to which he had been
communicating some benevolent scheme&mdash;'When he visits us he
always leaves something behind that is worth thinking of and
worth talking about.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir; as the spirit of the gospel is a liberal
so it is an active spirit. It does not wish to monopolize the immunities
of religion, but to diffuse them; and such is the intensity
and ardour of its benevolence that the meanest, the most abject child
of sorrow, the poor outcast from the common sympathies of humanity,
the forlorn object of woe whom few men would pity, whom no
man could save, are the partakers of its bounties."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"As the general well-being of society is essentially
benefited by the active benevolence of Christianity, may we not, Sir,
indulge a hope that the prosperity of vital religion in our different
communions, would be promoted by the cultivation of a reciprocal
affection?"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"There may be, I grant, external prosperity in
our churches, even while the vital spirit of religion is languishing in
the hearts of the people; as the oak may send forth its spreading
branches and luxuriant foliage, when at the heart the tree is hollow
and rotten. And perhaps the vital spirit of religion is exposed to more
danger in the season of external prosperity than in the season of
external adversity. When the congregation is large, and the spirit
of unanimity and liberality is generally displayed&mdash;when a cordial
attachment subsists between the pastors and their people; and the
lookers-on are heard to exclaim, <em>they are of one heart and of one soul</em>,
some may be tempted to forget from whom these invaluable blessings
proceed, and cherish a self-complacent, if not an independent
spirit. But I never knew vital religion flourish amongst any people
<em>who were not united</em>. The Spirit of the Holy One never comes to
breathe on the dry bones of the slain when the valley echoes with
the neighing of the horses, and the rattling of the chariots of war.
Wars must be made to cease, the bow must be broken, and the spear
cut in sunder&mdash;the chariots must be burned in the fire, and the tranquillity
of unruffled peace must reign over the whole scene, ere he
descends to unite the disjointed parts, and animate the lifeless body.
It is to the influence of the Holy Spirit over the mind that we are
to ascribe that portion of vital religion which we enjoy. He still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
dwells amongst us, yet not in the plenitude of his power. <em>Occasionally</em>
he descends in the ministry of reconciliation, and effects
a moral transformation on the character of a large proportion of
the people, as in the islands of the Pacific Ocean; but in general,
the exercise of his power is restricted to a small number in our
congregations, who are, at distinct and distant intervals, made alive
from the dead. But as this is emphatically termed the dispensation
of the Spirit, and as the honour of glorifying Christ, in giving
efficacy to the truth which he has revealed and attested, is reserved
for <em>Him</em>, to what secondary cause shall we attribute his very partial
communications, except to the offence which our discords and alienation
of attachment have given him? If He require peace and affection
in an individual church, as the precursors of his gracious visitations,
does He not require the same amongst the separate divisions
of his universal church?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Lewellin.</em>&mdash;"Most unquestionably, Sir, though the fact has
not produced that deep impression on the popular mind which its
importance demands. But the day of peace, I hope, is dawning upon
us, and the union of Christians of various denominations will, I trust,
be drawn closer as time moves on in its course. The voice of prayer
is more frequently and more generally heard for the outpouring of
Divine influence on the external means of grace, and already we see
here and there some verdant spots of spiritual beauty and of life,
amidst the surrounding desolations of evil and of death; thus exhibiting
to us, as in miniature, the future state of the whole moral
world, 'when judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
remain in the fruitful field; and when the work of righteousness
shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance
for ever.'"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"The miraculous gifts with which the apostles
were endowed, while they had to contend 'against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in the high places' of pagan idolatry, and social
profligacy, have long since ceased, with the exigency which called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
them forth; but the renewing and sanctifying agency of the Spirit
remains, and will continue to the end of time&mdash;the express declaration
of our Saviour not admitting of a doubt of its perpetuity:&mdash;'And
I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
that he may abide with you for ever.' And if, as we have reason
to believe, his extraordinary outpouring on our churches will not
take place till we are united in the bonds of peace, it behoves each
individual Christian to cultivate the spirit of concord, with the
utmost degree of vigilance and caution. To our prayers for his concurring
testimony with the word of life, we must add a watchfulness
over our own tempers, lest we should be involved in the charge
of preventing the bestowal of the blessing which we solicit, by
grieving the Agent on whose will it depends."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Your remarks, Sir, are just, and I wish they
were deeply engraven on the heart of every Christian, by the Spirit
of the living God; and then the ministration of righteousness, intrusted
to us, would display a glory surpassing the brightest emanation
of the Divine presence which the annals of the church record.
Then we should see the prejudices of the people, which now obstruct
the progress of pure evangelical religion, giving way; and the
result would bear a spiritual resemblance to the blessed effects produced
by the descent of the angel of Bethesda."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Lewellin.</em>&mdash;"May we not suppose, Sir, that the general impression
which is produced amongst the pious of all denominations
of the absolute necessity of the outpouring of the Spirit on the
labours of ministers at home, and of missionaries in foreign parts,
viewed in connection with the growing liberality and esteem we
cherish towards each other, is one of the spiritual signs which indicate
the bestowal of the blessing so earnestly implored?"</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"I think we may. It is the beginning of that
great work which the Divine Spirit will complete when the fulness
of the time comes, and the effects of which being of a moral and
spiritual nature, will continue to bless the world after the subordinate
agents of its production have entered into rest. 'Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness.'"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Lewellin.</em>&mdash;"And as this union and affection will form one
of the most powerful evidences of the divinity of our Lord's mission,
it will, at the same time, be a practical refutation of some of the
charges which have been brought against Christianity, as though it
had an anti-social and repulsive tendency; and it will also exhibit
the finest representation of the internal economy of the heavenly
world which can be given. <em>There</em> is diversity of rank but unity of
thought; and though the various orders of beings may occupy
superior and subordinate stations under the government of the
Eternal King, yet no one is envious of another's elevation, or
jealous of another's influence."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"There is one circumstance connected with
our entrance into heaven, which I think ought not to be overlooked.
It is this. When we enter, or when we are anticipating that great
event, we shall place no dependence on our distinctive peculiarities;
nor advert to them, except to express our regret on account of the
evil effects which they too often produce. At that period in the history
of our being, the mind will be too deeply absorbed in the contemplation
of its specific character and condition&mdash;will be too solemnly
affected by the anticipation of its final destiny, and will feel too
deeply abased, under a consciousness of its utter unworthiness of
the Divine favour, to dwell even for a moment on any other subject
than its redemption from all evil and from all misery by the death
of the Lord Jesus Christ. In comparison with this, every other
subject that has engrossed our attention, or interested our feelings,
will vanish away, as a thing of nought; and after having thus
disengaged ourselves from all association with the minor questions,
which now agitate, and divide, and dishonour us, we shall be free
to enter the joy of our Lord, as sinners redeemed by his blood,
rather than as saints belonging to any one denomination of Christians."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"I have just had, Sir, a practical illustration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the truthfulness of your observations. I was sent for early, a few
mornings ago, to visit a pious member of my own church, and in
the evening of the same day, at the request of a friend, I went
to see a member of a Dissenting church, a very godly man; and, to
the rejoicing of my heart, I found them breathing the same spirit&mdash;avowing
the same belief&mdash;deriving consolation from the same source&mdash;and
giving utterance to the joyful anticipations of mingling their
grateful feelings together in the same heavenly temple, where they
hope to serve the Lord day and night in harmony and peace."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Lewellin.</em>&mdash;"And, as we shall mingle together in heaven, I
presume, Sir, we shall <em>know</em> each other <em>there</em>. Some pious Christians
entertain doubts on this subject, but as it is one which has such a
tendency to reconcile our minds to the departure of our friends, I
cannot avoid cherishing it with fond attachment."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir, some good people have their doubts
on the subject; but I wonder how they can entertain them. Even
though on such a subject we receive no light from the testimony of
Scripture, still it is so congenial with the dictates of enlightened
reason, and the warm attachments of pure friendship, that I am at
a loss to conceive how any one can disbelieve it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Deep, deep the love we bear unto the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' adoring reverence that we humbly pay<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><em>Mr. Roscoe.</em>&mdash;"Nothing, in my opinion, is more calculated to dispel
the fear of death, than a firm belief that we are going home to dwell
in our Father's house along with our departed brethren in Christ,
whom we shall meet and recognize. This thought, which is so gratifying
to our feelings, is supported, I think, by the language of the
New Testament."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Ingleby.</em>&mdash;"I think so too. The apostle, when writing
to the Colossians, says, 'That we may present every man perfect in
Christ Jesus;' by which, says Dr. Paley, I understand St. Paul to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
express his hope and prayer, that at the general judgment of the
world, he might present the fruits of his ministry perfect in every
good work; and if this be rightly interpreted, then it affords a manifest
and necessary inference that the saints in a future life will meet
and be known again to one another; for how, without knowing again
his converts in their new and glorified state, could St. Paul desire
or expect to present them at the last day? The celebrated Baxter
says, and I think there is much force in the statement, 'I must confess
as the experience of my own soul, that the expectation of loving
my friends in heaven, principally kindles my love to them on earth.
If I thought I should never know them, and consequently never love
them after this life is ended, I should in reason number them with
temporal things, and love them as such; but I now delightfully converse
with my pious friends, in a firm persuasion that I shall converse
with them for ever; and I take comfort in those of them that
are dead, or absent, as believing I shall shortly meet them in heaven,
and love them with a heavenly love that shall there be perfected.'"</p>

<p>"Then," said Miss Roscoe, "death will merely suspend our intercourse
with our friends for a little while&mdash;it will not break it off for
ever. This is a thrilling subject of thought and meditation. We
part, but shall meet again in a purer and happier world, and in
a more glorious form, and then we part no more. We may then
hail Death as a herald of mercy, instead of shrinking from his approach
as the King of Terrors."</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Guion.</em>&mdash;"Then, when mingling together, if we ever advert
to the scenes of our earthly existence, as we probably shall often do,
we shall rejoice that our union is now complete, unbroken by any
discordant opinion; and, while exulting amidst the unfading glories
of the celestial world, we shall gratefully ascribe our salvation to the
free and discriminating grace of God, our Father and Redeemer."</p>

<h2>THE STAGE COACH.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The time had now come for my departure from Fairmount,
which I quitted with much regret, Mr. Lewellin
accompanying me as far as London, where it was
arranged that I should stay a few days with him previous
to returning home. Our kind friends were very urgent in pressing
us to remain a little longer; but business required Mr. Lewellin's
immediate attention, and I was getting anxious to resume my pastoral
duties. We left Fairmount in the carriage early in the morning,
and reached the turnpike gate about a quarter of an hour before
the mail came up. There was one outside passenger, and two inside.
Having bidden adieu to Mr. Stevens, who had accompanied us thus
far, we stepped in, heard the well-known signal from the guard,
<em>All's right!</em> and felt ourselves moving towards the imperial city at a
rapid pace. Though I have not, like Lavater, studied physiognomy,
and have often experienced the fallacy of its conclusions, yet on this
occasion, as on most others, I began to examine and note carefully
the features of the two strangers who sat opposite me. The one
was a Friend, who had long since passed the meridian of life. He
was dressed in the neat garb of his order, had a fine Roman nose,
keen blue eyes rather deeply set, and a countenance whose expression
of intelligence and benignity strongly prepossessed me in his
favour. But had his general appearance been less attractive, I
should have felt a profound respect, as I once had a mother who
spoke the plain language, and taught me to speak it in my younger
days; and though in riper years, I left the denomination of my
youth, yet I still revere that interesting Society of professing Christians.
The other was a lusty gentleman, about the age of fifty, but
there was no feature in his face that gave me any pleasure.</p>
</div>

<p>We rode on in silence, till we came to D&mdash;&mdash;s, where we changed
horses; and while we were waiting for the guard, who was detained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at the post office, we amused ourselves in looking at a group of boys
who were playing at trap-ball, in the market-place. The stout
gentleman (whom I shall call Mr. Sykes) said, pointing to the boys,
"There is perfect happiness." As no one offered to make any
reply to this remark, Mr. Lewellin observed, "Perhaps, Sir, their
happiness is not perfect. In the midst of their gambols, and while
feeling elated with the high honour of winning the game, the sudden
recollection of a lesson yet unlearned, that must be said to-morrow,
may perchance give them a pang." This natural remark, expressed
in the most good-natured manner, gave offence to Mr. Sykes, who,
assuming that demeanour of defiance which appeared most natural to
him, said, "And pray, Sir, do you not suppose that the happiness of
childhood is the most perfect happiness which mortals ever enjoy!"
"It ought not to be, Sir," replied my friend in a very modest tone.
"Ought not to be, Sir!" Mr. Sykes returned, with some degree of sarcastic
warmth; "then, Sir, how must you have spent those days of
innocent mirth, not to be able to look back on them with envy!"
This sarcasm roused the spirit of my friend Lewellin, who, though
mild, was not disposed to be run down by unprovoked insolence;
and he said, in a tone somewhat elevated, "Then I presume, Sir,
you look back to the days of your childhood, and sigh over joys
departed, never to return; but permit me to ask, how have you
spent the years of manhood, not to have yet attained the possession
of a much more rational and exalted happiness than you enjoyed
when you were flying a kite or spinning a top? If you think,
Sir, that I misimproved my boyish days, by not acquiring that
perfection of happiness which they generally bring, you force me to
conclude that you have misimproved the years of manhood, if in
the decline of life you are compelled to look back to your childish
days, as the happiest you have ever known."</p>

<p>Mr. Sykes, perceiving, from the smartness of this reply, that he
stood no chance of carrying his point, without assistance, turned
round, and appealed to the Friend, who did not appear to have
taken any interest in the question. "Why, truly," said the Friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"I think with my neighbour opposite, that if thou wert more happy
when a boy, than thou art now, thou canst not have improved thy
time as thou oughtest to have done." "Well," said Mr. Sykes, "as
this is the first company in which I have ever heard the sentiment
called in question, I suppose I am along with a class of human
beings of a new order." "Perhaps thou art," rejoined the Friend,
"and at any rate thou must confess, that this new order of human
beings, as thou art pleased to term us, excel all thy former associates
in one very important point." "In what point, Sir?" inquired Mr.
Sykes, in his native tone. "Why in this: while thou and thy friends
have outlived your happiest days, we are now enjoying ours. Hence,
while it is to our advantage to live in a state of manhood, it would
have been to yours, to have continued in a state of childhood."</p>

<p>This remark re-established the reign of silence, which continued
undisturbed, till some children ran out from a few miserable-looking
huts, which stood near the roadside, and followed the coach
for a considerable distance, attempting to excite our generosity, by
their piteous moans, and antic gestures. "There, Sir," said Mr.
Sykes, "If you look out, you will see the picture of perfect happiness."
Our sagacious Friend, who appeared to have high purposes
revolving in his breast when not engaged in conversation, was
rather startled by this observation, as he had not seen the group of
juvenile beggars, by which we were annoyed; but on looking out, as
requested, he shrewdly replied, "I was not aware that perfect happiness
was reduced so low in life, as to become a common beggar."
"Poverty, Sir," said Mr. Sykes, "is no disgrace, and poor people are
happy as well as rich." "Very true," replied the Friend; "but it
is a disgrace to any parents, to train up their children to the practice
of begging. These children certainly look healthy and sprightly,
but if thou wert to be present when they return from an unsuccessful
race, thou wouldest see a picture of perfect sorrow." "Well,"
said Mr. Sykes, "they shall have one happy day," and immediately
tossed out a few halfpence. "Now," said the Friend, "if thou wilt
look back, probably thou wilt see a violent contention between them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
some crying because unable to get the prize, and some fighting over
the division of the spoil." "I suppose, Sir," Mr. Sykes remarked
sarcastically, "no one ever fought over any of your scattered gifts."
"I never saw any," the Friend replied, "as I am not in the habit of
scattering my gifts with an indiscriminate hand; nor do I approve
of those acts, misnamed charitable, which have an evil tendency."
"But, Sir," said Mr. Sykes, "what evil can result from giving a few
pence to some poor miserable-looking boys and girls?" "Why,"
replied the Friend, "thou hast seen one evil in the contention which
immediately followed, but this is not the greatest; these children
who are initiated into the begging system at such an early period
of life, are taught the art of deception; they are thrown off from
the resources of industry and frugality, on the precarious supplies
of charity; and if from the influence of vagrancy, they are not led
to thieving, they will never feel any reluctance to receive support
from the parish rate. Charity is a virtue which we all admire, and
which we ought to cultivate; but I have long thought, that where
its bounties are not administered with discretion, society sustains
more injury, than it derives advantage." "Discretion! O yes, discretion!"
said Mr. Sykes, "is a great virtue; with Sir John Falstaff
it is the better part of valour, with you of charity; but in my opinion
it is more frequently an apology for cowardice, or for covetousness."</p>

<p>Vol. ii. p. 55.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We soon after parted with Mr. Sykes, when our sage Friend addressing
himself to Mr. Lewellin, said, "I have no doubt but the
passenger who has just left us has some excellencies, but he does
not excel in the art of rendering himself agreeable, an art which
few learn, and fewer practise; but it is one of great importance to
personal dignity and relative comfort."</p>

<p>His place in the coach was soon occupied by a young man in a
red coat, who was going to a fox-hunt near M&mdash;&mdash;. He was very
loquacious, but his conversation turned principally on horses, and
dogs, and game, and the various qualifications of a good shot. Mr.
Lewellin made several efforts to introduce other topics, but he could
not succeed, as no pointer ever stood truer to his bird, than he did to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his favourite theme. He told us of his hair-breadth escapes, of the
fatigues which he had endured, and the feats which he had achieved,
with as much glee as the huntsman throws off at a chase; and dwelt
with peculiar delight on his good fortune the preceding day, when
out of twenty-five who started, he was the only one <em>in at the death</em>,
and exhibited the <em>brush</em> as the proud memorial of his honour. After
he had told and re-told his tales, which gave no one pleasure but
himself, he fell into a dead silence, hummed "Old Towler," and
commenced beating a sort of tattoo with his fingers on the coach window.
At length, turning himself to the Friend who sat by his side,
and whose patriarchal simplicity appeared to amuse him, he said,
with an air of low satire, "I believe, Sir, your sect are not much
given to such sports?" "Why, no," replied the Friend, "we have
too much humanity, to attempt to extract pleasure from the sports
which inflict torture on dumb animals." "I have read," said the
sportsman, "all your objections; but, Sir, they have no point&mdash;they
don't hit the mark&mdash;nature points to game, and we are to
follow. I love the sound of the horn, more than the silence of
meditation." "I have no doubt," said the Friend, "that thou dost,
but thou shouldst remember, that some prefer silence, to noise."
"I take you, Sir; you intend to say, that you would rather have
silence, than my conversation." "I have no objection," the Friend
replied, "to conversation, when it is interesting or profitable, but
thou must be aware, that the present company take no interest in
the detail of thy field achievements." "Well, Sir," said the sportsman,
"I have no objection to turn the conversation to a graver
subject; and as I am a young man, just beginning to turn my
attention to religion, you will permit me to ask you one question,
which puzzles me. It is this, Sir: As we have so many religions in
this kingdom, which is the best?" "Why," said the Friend, "that
which makes the simple wise, and teaches young men to cultivate
the grace of modesty." "Very smart, Sir: then you think such a
religion would do me good?" "I think it would."</p>

<p>When the sportsman left us, his place was immediately occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
by a gentleman who, as I afterwards learned, had lately returned to
England, after an absence of many years. He was an interesting
and intelligent looking man; and I flattered myself from his general
appearance, that we should have agreeable society during the rest
of our journey. Nor was I disappointed. He was rather reserved
at first, but after Mr. Lewellin and I had engaged for some time in
a desultory conversation, he fell in with us, and willingly contributed
his share. There is a strong propensity in some minds to sacrifice
truth, in narration and description, especially when relating their
own adventures. They will not utter direct and palpable falsehood,
but they are so accustomed to exaggeration and high colouring, that
a man who respects his own reputation will never venture to repeat
their statements. Their design is to produce <em>effect</em>, and hence they
often leave the beaten path of sober truth to amuse or astonish their
hearers with the fanciful or the extravagant. But nothing of this
kind was visible in our companion; as he gave us no description of
persons, of places, or of things, which staggered our belief. He had
sailed on the boisterous sea, without having just escaped the horrors
of shipwreck; he had passed through woods and mountains, without
encountering brigands or assassins; he had resided in crowded cities,
and had traversed lonely wastes, where he met with no flattering
attentions from the great, or rude insults from the vulgar. He had
travelled through the greater part of Europe, had visited the East
and West Indies, and had spent the last two years in America: but
intended now to fix his abode in his native country, where he said
he hoped to rest in the same grave with his fathers.</p>

<p>"You have seen, Sir," I remarked, "a great part of the world; but
as you intend to fix your final residence in Old England, I take for
granted that you have not discovered any country which rivals her
in your estimation."</p>

<p>"No, Sir," he replied, "I have not. I love England&mdash;I love her
changing seasons, and her fruitful soil&mdash;her fine national character&mdash;her
political constitution, and that spirit of liberty, both civil and
religious, which she cherishes and which she diffuses&mdash;I love everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that is English; and I disown the Briton who is not enthusiastic
in the praise of his country."</p>

<p>"The love of liberty," I remarked, "is a passion which gives a
peculiar and powerful energy to our national character; but you
must confess, Sir, that this passion is not exclusively ours. America
cherishes it with an equal degree of ardour."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," he replied, "she does, but her love of liberty is a
selfish passion. She has fought for her own freedom, and she has
won the laurels, but she continues to enslave others. When the
foot of a poor captive touches the soil of Britain, his chains burst
from around him; his life is taken under the protection of the law;
no one can insult him with impunity; he is as safe in his hut, as
the lordly baron is within the walls of his castle. But in the United
States of America, there are upwards of three millions of human
beings, now living in a state of slavery, bought and sold like cattle&mdash;subjected
to the cruelty of men, in whose bosoms every atom of
humanity has long since been annihilated. What, Sir, is freedom,
where all are not free&mdash;where the greatest of God's blessings is
limited with impious caprice to the colour of the skin? Having
bled at every pore, rather than submit to wear the yoke of a foreign
authority, why does she not, amid all her prosperity and improvement,
act a just and generous part towards her black population?
She is worse than the chief butler of Pharaoh, who, when he had
gained his freedom, merely forgot his fellow-prisoner: but she remembers
those who were once in bondage with her, and rivets the
chains of slavery still closer upon them. She may vaunt herself on
the love of liberty, and on her rising greatness in the scale of
nations; but as long as the groans of three millions of human beings
resound through her land without obtaining redress, she will have
a badge of infamy affixed to her national character, from which no
virtues will ever redeem her. We did a noble deed when we
abolished the slave-trade, but we did a still nobler deed when we
abolished slavery. We have thus set America a good example,
which, in spite of all opposition, she will some day follow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>We were very much pleased with the polite manners and the
interesting conversation of this gentleman, who formed a striking
contrast to our other coach companions. On taking leave of him
at the Swan with two Necks, we exchanged cards, when we found
that the stranger's name was Wilcox, and he exacted a promise
from me that I would call and see him before I left London.</p>

<p>A few days after this, as I sat in Mr. Lewellin's front parlour
listening to the strange cries of London, and observing the countenances
of the numerous pedestrians, who, with hurried steps,
passed to and fro, as though each was intent on some great purpose,
I saw the postman at the door, who brought me a letter,
which on opening I found to be from our interesting fellow-traveller,
requesting that we would dine with him on the following day. We
accepted the invitation, and spent a very pleasant evening together.</p>

<p>On this occasion Mr. Wilcox informed us that he had been
pressed to sign a petition for the repeal of the Maynooth grant;
but had declined doing so, because he knew nothing about its
origin, or the reasons which induced the government to make it;
adding that, as a general rule, he thought America acted more
wisely than we do on all such questions; she repudiates a <em>state
religion</em>, and therefore leaves every religious sect to act and provide
for itself. I then gave him a brief history of the matter as
follows:&mdash;On the 14th of January, 1794, the Roman Catholics of
Ireland presented a memorial to the government, praying for permission
to erect a college for the education of their priests, who, up
to this time, had been compelled to get their education in foreign
countries; stating in their memorial, that they were both able and
willing to build the college, and defray its current expenditure at
their own expense. Their prayer was granted: and to their astonishment
the Irish Parliament voted a grant of Â£8000 per annum
towards its support, which in the year 1807 was increased to
Â£13,000. No pledge was given that it should be a permanent grant,
and as a proof of this, in the year 1799 it was withheld altogether,
and during that year they were compelled to do what they said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
when they declared that they were able and willing to defray its
expenses by their own voluntary contributions.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"It seems somewhat strange," said Mr. Wilcox, "that the government
should vote a large sum of money, when they are told that
it is neither expected nor needed. To account for such an act of
profligate expenditure, we must suppose there was a strong undercurrent
of political influence forcing them to do so."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir, the fact is, that Ireland was at this time, and for a
long time after, in a strongly excited state; one outburst of popular
tumult succeeded another, with so much rapidity and violence, that
our leading statesmen, both Whigs and Tories, became alarmed, and
they hit upon the expedient of attempting to conciliate the priests,
by proposing to take their church into union with the state, and
thus render them independent of the voluntary contributions of
their people; and this munificent generosity in behalf of the Maynooth
College, was the gilded bait of allurement. However, that
projected union is now abandoned as a Utopian vagary; for the
Roman Catholics disdain to come into ecclesiastical fellowship with
Protestants, and therefore common sense requires, that as they are
resolved to stand by themselves, they should be left to do what they
said they were able and willing to do&mdash;educate and support their
clergy by their own contributions."</p>

<p>"I think the principle is bad," said Mr. Wilcox, "both politically
and morally, which compels one sect to educate and support the
clergy of another sect. There is an outrage committed on the conscience
of an enlightened Protestant, if he be compelled to contribute
to the education and support of the Roman Catholic clergy, not
simply because they are the ministers of another church, but because
they are ministers who, in his estimation, reject the essential doctrines
of Christianity, and substitute in their place, dangerous and
fatal heresies; and not only so, but he believes, and their past history
confirms him in the belief, that they constitute the vital, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
active, and the most unscrupulous part of an organized conspiracy,
whose object is to extinguish both civil and religious liberty throughout
the world."</p>

<p>"Toleration," said Mr. Lewellin, "is all that such a dangerous set
of men ought to receive under a Protestant government, and to that
I should not object; but it is an act of legalized injustice to compel
me to pay for the training and comfortable support of Roman
Catholic priests."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilcox remarked, "We don't punish the footpad till he has
committed his crime; but we should deem the wealthy traveller a
maniac at large, who would voluntarily contribute towards the training
of such desperadoes. I will certainly, now that I understand the
matter, sign for the repeal of the grant, and do all in my power to
hasten it. Indeed, I would not give my vote to any parliamentary
candidate, unless he pledged himself against the continuance of this
very obnoxious grant."</p>

<p>"My attachment to Christianity," said Mr. Lewellin, "makes me
revolt against this offensive grant, as my loyalty to our queen would
make me abhor a proposition to contribute to the training of traitors,
to subvert her throne and bring her to the block."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h2>A SABBATH IN LONDON.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_073.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I n the institution of the Christian ministry, we have
one of the most salutary provisions ever made to promote
the improvement and happiness of man. If we
suppose, with the enemies of Christianity, that it is
of human origin, and that its functions are discharged by human
agents, who are actuated and governed by selfish or ambitious
motives, still it will occupy, in the estimation of every wise man, a
high station, as a powerful ally to the cause of patriotism and of
virtue. It enjoins on the various ranks and orders of society submission
to the powers that be, and reverence for God; and it explains
and enforces, with the utmost precision, our relative duties towards
each other; while the veneration in which it is generally held in
this kingdom is favourable to its influence. To say that every one
is strictly virtuous who listens to its maxims of wisdom, would be to
advance an assertion which facts would contradict; but if we judge
from the present state of society, we shall be compelled to admit that
there is a larger portion of virtue amongst those who attend upon a
stated ministry, than among those who treat it with neglect and
scorn. Hence its abolition would be a national evil, as disastrous to
our moral improvement and happiness, as the triumphs of political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
anarchy would be to the well-balanced constitution of the British
Empire.</p>
</div>

<p>But even this institution, with all its advantages, would prove
comparatively useless were it not for the appointment of the Christian
Sabbath; for such is the ascendency which the cares, the pleasures,
the fascinations, and the commerce of the world have acquired
over the public mind, that very few would have an opportunity to
benefit by it, unless some specific portion of time was set apart for
this express purpose. If the husbandman were compelled to toil in
the field, and the mechanic to labour in the shop&mdash;if the tradesman,
the merchant, and the other members of the community had to devote
themselves to their respective avocations without any intermission,
except what caprice or indolence might dictate, the minister of the
gospel might faithfully proclaim all the words which relate to the
life to come, but he would not be surrounded by a large and an attentive
audience. The temple would be forsaken, and the powers of <em>this</em>
world would so engross the attention of men, that those of the next
would be generally, if not universally disregarded. To prevent this
fatal evil, one day in seven is set apart, by the immediate authority
of God, which we are commanded to devote to the exercises of private
and public worship; but alas! how many treat this sacred injunction
with contempt. Some in the higher ranks of life, who disdain
to be thought religious, employ it as a day for travelling or for feasting;
and multitudes of the lower orders, regard it as a day either
for pleasure or for dissipation.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath after my arrival in London, as I was walking
down Bridge Street on my way to Surrey Chapel, I saw a party of
young people whose gaiety of manner ill accorded with the sanctity
of the day, and just as I was passing them I heard one say, "Indeed
I think we shall do wrong; my conscience condemns me; I must
return." "There can be no harm," replied another, "in taking an
excursion on the water, especially as we intend to go to chapel in the
evening." "I must return," rejoined a female voice; "my conscience
condemns me. What will father say if he hears of it?" By this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
time they had reached the bridge, and the foremost of the party was
busily engaged with a waterman, while the rest stood in close debate
for some minutes, when they all moved forward towards the water.</p>

<p>I watched the party as they went down the stairs to the river.
Two of the gentlemen stepped into the boat, two more stood at the
water's edge, and the females were handed in one after another; but
I could perceive great reluctance on the part of the one who had
previously objected, till at length she yielded to the importunities of
her companions, and the boat was pushed off. It was a fine morning,
though rather cold. Many, like myself, were gazing on them, when
a naval officer called to them through the balustrades and said, "A
pleasant voyage to you." One of the gentlemen arose to return the
compliment, but, from some cause which I could not perceive, he
missed his footing and fell into the water. This disaster threw the
whole party into the utmost consternation; and each one, instead of
retaining his seat, rushed to the side of the boat over which their
companion had fallen, by which the boat was upset, and all were
instantaneously plunged into the river. The scene which followed,
when the spectators beheld this calamity, exceeded any I had ever
witnessed. Some females screamed, the passers-by crowded together
to the parapet of the bridge, and everything was bustle and excitement;
boats immediately put off; and in a few minutes I had the
satisfaction of seeing the watermen rescue one, and another, and
another from a premature grave. Having picked up every one they
could find, the different boats were rowed to shore, where some
medical gentlemen were in waiting. But when the party met together,
no language can describe the horror depicted on every countenance
when they found that two were still missing.</p>

<p>"Where's my sister?" said the voice which had said, only a few
minutes before, "There can be no harm in taking an excursion on
the water, especially as we intend to go to chapel in the evening."</p>

<p>"Where's Charles?" said a female, who had appeared the most
gay and sprightly when I first saw them.</p>

<p>At length two boats, which had gone a considerable distance up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the river, were seen returning; and on being asked if they had picked
up any one, they replied, "Yes; two." This reply electrified the
whole party, and some wept for joy.</p>

<p>"Here's a gentleman," said a waterman as he was coming up to
the foot of the stairs, "but I suspect he's dead."</p>

<p>"Where's the lady?" said her brother, "Is she safe?"</p>

<p>"She is in the other boat, Sir."</p>

<p>"Is she alive?&mdash;Has she spoken?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir, she has not spoken, I believe."</p>

<p>"Is she dead; O tell me!"</p>

<p>"I fear she is, Sir."</p>

<p>The bodies were immediately removed from the boats to a house
in the vicinity, and every effort was employed to restore animation.
In little more than ten minutes it was announced that the gentleman
began to breathe, but there was no allusion made to the lady.
Her brother sat motionless, absorbed in the deepest melancholy, till
the actual decease of his sister was announced, when he started up
and became almost frantic with grief; and though his companions
tried to comfort him, yet he refused to hear the words of consolation.</p>

<p>"O my sister! my sister! Would to God I had died for her!"</p>

<p>They were all overwhelmed in trouble, and knew not what to do.
"Who will bear the heavy tidings to our father?" said the brother,
who paced the room backwards and forwards. "O! who will bear
the heavy tidings to our father?" He paused; a death-like silence
pervaded the whole apartment. He again burst forth in the agonies
of despair&mdash;"I forced her to go against the dictates of her conscience;
I am her murderer; I ought to have perished, and not my sister.
Who will bear the heavy tidings to our father?"</p>

<p>"I will," said a gentleman, who had been unremitting in his attentions
to the sufferers.</p>

<p>"Do you know him, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him."</p>

<p>"O! how can I ever appear in his presence! I enticed my only
sister to an act of disobedience, which has destroyed her!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>How the father received the intelligence, or what moral effect
resulted from the disaster, I never heard, but it suggests a few
reflections which I wish to press upon the attention of my readers.
As the Sabbath is instituted for the purpose of promoting your
moral improvement and happiness, never devote its sacred hours to
pleasure and recreations. He who has commanded you to keep it
holy, will not suffer you to profane it with impunity. He may not
bring down upon you the awful expressions of his displeasure while
you are in the act of setting his authority at open defiance, but there
is a day approaching when you must stand before him as your judge.
And can you anticipate the solemnities of that day, while continuing
in a course of sin, with any other than the most fearful apprehensions?
You may, like many, suppose that that day is very far off;
but you may be undeceived by a sudden visitation of Providence;
and in a moment may be removed from amongst your gay companions,
to appear in his presence. And should this be the case,
with what terror-struck amazement will you look on the awful scene
around you; with what fearful and agonizing emotions will you
listen to the final sentence&mdash;<em>Depart!</em></p>

<p>Resist the <em>first</em> temptation to evil, or your ruin may be the inevitable
consequence. "Indeed I think we shall do wrong; my conscience
condemns me; I must return," said the unfortunate girl,
when she got near the river; but having yielded to the first temptation,
she was induced to overcome her scruples, and within less than
half an hour from that time she was hurried into the eternal world.
Had she refused when her brother solicited her to leave home,
she might have lived to comfort her father in his old age; but by
complying, she first lost her strength to withstand temptation, and
then her life. What a warning! And is this the only one which
the history of crime has given you? Alas, no! Have not many,
who have ended their days on the scaffold, traced their ruin to the
profanation of the Sabbath? This is the day in which the spirits of
evil are abroad, enticing the young and the thoughtless to vice and
impiety; and if you wish to avoid the misery and degradation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which others have been involved, devote its sacred hours to the purpose
for which they were appointed. Attend some place of worship,
where the truths of the Bible are preached with earnestness and
power, and attend regularly; and though some of your associates may
ridicule you for your habits of devotion, yet will you suffer yourself
to be conquered by such weapons? The youth who regularly attends
a place of worship on the Sabbath, and receives the truth under a
deep conviction of its excellence and importance, often enjoys a high
mental feast, and becomes imperceptibly fortified to resist the fascinations
of the world; but he who spends the sacred hours in the
society of the thoughtless, amidst scenes of gaiety and dissipation,
becomes an easy prey to the worst of temptations, often retires to
rest reproaching himself for his folly and impiety, and is gradually
led from one crime to another till iniquity proves his ruin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I wished to hear a celebrated preacher in the evening, I asked
Mr. Lewellin to accompany me, but he declined, for reasons which
raised him in my estimation as a young man of prudence and consistency.
"I am, Sir," he observed, "decidedly of opinion that London
offers many temptations to professors of religion which require,
on their part, constant vigilance to withstand; and one of the most
specious is, the celebrity of popular preachers."</p>

<p>"But," I replied, "do you think it wrong to go and hear these
ministers?"</p>

<p>"I would be cautious how I censured any one; but I certainly
think that the love of novelty in religion often proves pernicious,
not only to those who are enslaved by it, but to their families. Let
me suppose a case. Here is a religious family who professedly
attend the ministry of the Rev. Mr. Watkins, but the father is in
the habit of hearing every celebrated preacher. Will not this roving
disposition prevent his forming that attachment towards a pastor
and his flock in which the essence of Christian fellowship consists?
And will not the influence of his example have an injurious effect on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his children? If he take them with him, he imperceptibly teaches
them to believe that he is not so much delighted with the truth as
with the agent who conveys it. And what is this but sinking the importance
and value of the truth in the estimation of those whose hearts
are naturally averse to it. If he refuse to take them with him, and
compel them to go, while they are young, to their regular place of
worship, yet, as he does not go with them, they are left without the
controlling influence of his presence, and are exposed to the temptation
of absenting themselves for some scene of amusement. If he
leave his more stated minister to go after these popular preachers,
unless he has a greater measure of prudence than such roving professors
generally possess, he will institute comparisons in the presence
of his children between them and the settled pastor. And will not
this excite prejudice in their minds against the clergyman whose
ministry they are <em>forced</em> to attend? Will not this prove injurious
to them? Will not this tend to alienate their minds from the love
of the truth, and to make them regard its accidental associations as
the main thing; and by teaching them disrespect for their stated
minister, they may, in time, turn away contemptuously from the
message he delivers. And these are not the only evils which result
from the indulgence of this roving disposition; it is invariably
found no less injurious to the private reputation of a Christian, than
to his domestic piety."</p>

<p>"But how so?" I replied. "What injury can it do the private
reputation of a Christian?"</p>

<p>"Why, he will be regarded as an unstable man; and though he
may have many virtues, yet if this imperfection be associated with
them it will materially injure him. For what influence can an
unstable man ever acquire, unless it be the power of doing evil?
Who can respect him? Who can place any dependence on him?"</p>

<p>"But," I asked, "may not a Christian leave the ministry of one
preacher, to attend that of another, without sustaining or producing
any moral injury?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," said Mr. Lewellin; "we are at perfect liberty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
go where we please, and to hear whom we please; but we should
avoid that fickleness of disposition, which is ever moving from one
place to another. Some admire the last preacher they have heard
more than any preceding one, and have the censer always ready to
throw the incense of flattery around the <em>next</em> who may make his
appearance. Instead of examining themselves, to see what progress
they make in knowledge and in grace, and attending to the religious
instruction of their children and their servants on the Sabbath, they
are ever asking, Who is in town? or, Who is expected? But though
I condemn most decidedly such a volatile spirit amongst professors,
yet I think we <em>ought</em> to attend that ministry which we find the most
profitable. <em>The truth which we hear is Divine, but the agent who
preaches it is human</em>; and though the tone and the manner of proclaiming
it will not add to its importance, yet it may tend to give it
a more commanding power of impression; and hence, it is both our
duty and our privilege to attend the ministry of that man, whose style
of preaching is the most calculated to profit us. The poet in speaking
of government, has said,</p>

<p class="center">
'Whate'er is best administered is best.'
</p>

<p class="noind">The same may be nearly said with regard to sermons. There is not
such a great difference between the thoughts and arrangements of
one preacher and another as some imagine. But who has not been
struck with the difference of the impression and effect? One man
shall speak, and how dry, and sapless, and uninteresting is he! Let
another deliver the very same things, and there is a savour that
gives them freshness&mdash;the things seem perfectly new. One preacher,
by his monotonous tones and manner, soon lulls us to sleep; while
another, by his earnestness, his pathos, and his impassioned appeals&mdash;by
the aptness of his illustrations, the chasteness of his style,
and the unction of his spirit&mdash;not only fixes our attention, but
penetrates the inner man of the heart; we feel ourselves subdued,
enlightened, and powerfully excited by the Word of God. When a
man of this attractive order appears in the pulpit, by the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
action of the sympathetic faculty, his presence is felt by the people,
even before his voice is heard; and in the lines of Cowper we see a
great moral fact, clothed in the vestments of poetic beauty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When one that holds communion with the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has filled his urn where these pure waters rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once more mingles with us meaner things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis e'en as if an angel shook his wings&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal fragrance fills the circuit wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tells us whence <em>his</em> treasures are supplied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when a ship well freighted with the stores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun matures on India's spicy shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has dropp'd her anchor and her canvas furl'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some safe haven of our western world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere vain inquiring to what port she <em>went</em>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <em>gale</em> informs us, laden with the scent.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But, Sir," I remarked, "if we do not derive improvement and
consolation from the ministry on which we generally attend, we
ought to attribute it to some fault in ourselves. I remember being
very much struck with a remark which I heard a venerable clergyman
make when addressing his congregation&mdash;'If, my brethren,' he said,
'you come to hear <em>me preach</em>, instead of hearing <em>the truth</em> which I
deliver, be not surprised if you are permitted to go away without
having felt its purifying and consoling influence. I can do no more
than give utterance to the sublime doctrines and promises of the
gospel; it is the province of my Master to make them effectual to
your salvation; and if you neglect by strong and ardent prayer to
implore his blessing, he will withhold it.'"</p>

<p>"A very just and important remark," replied Mr. Lewellin, "and
one which I hope we shall never forget. We ought at all times to
go into the temple in a devotional spirit, and to remember that as
every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness,
neither shadow of turning, we should, in the most humble manner,
invoke his presence; and then we shall feel less disposed to rove and
less occasion to complain of the want of spiritual enjoyment."</p>

<p>We were now interrupted in our conversation, by the servant, who
informed Mr. Lewellin that there were two gentlemen below who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
wished to see him. "Desire them to walk up. I am not aware,"
said Mr. Lewellin, "who they are; and I regret their call, as I am
not in the habit of receiving company on the Sabbath." They
entered the room, and after offering an apology for this act of intrusion,
one said, "I know, Sir, you will excuse it, as I have made up
my mind to go with you to chapel this evening, along with our
friend Mr. Newton."</p>

<p>I did not immediately recollect this gentleman, though his manners
and voice seemed familiar to me; but on hearing his name,
I instantaneously recognized Mr. Gordon, whom I once met in the
country<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> when enjoying an evening's ramble. "I am happy to see
you, Sir" (addressing him), "as it gives me an opportunity of reminding
you of a promise which you have not yet redeemed."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir! You have the advantage of me. Did I ever
make you a promise, which I have not redeemed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, indeed you have done so."</p>

<p>"Where, and when, Sir, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Were you never in a thunder-storm?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I hope you are well. I am happy to see you
in London. I hope you will do me the honour of a call.&mdash;Why, no.
I have not been able to inform you of the result of my inquiry;
for, to be very candid, I have been too much engaged to turn my attention
to it; but I have not forgotten it.&mdash;What a storm! How
did you escape it? I took shelter in a cow-shed."</p>

<p>"I ran to a cottage, where I was kindly received, and in which I
witnessed a deeply interesting sight. I regretted you were not with
me, as I there saw an evidence in favour of the truth and the
excellence of the gospel, which I think you would have admired."</p>

<p>"Indeed! what visible evidence do you refer to? A miracle?"</p>

<p>"If we define a miracle to be something above the production of
human power, I should not hesitate to call what I saw a moral miracle."
I then gave an account of the decease of the woodman's child,
which he called a very interesting tale; but said he was not sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
enlightened to perceive how such a fact tended in any way to
establish the truth or display the excellence of Christianity. "We
may," he remarked, "have an opportunity to debate over it before
you leave our great city; but, as we propose going to chapel this
evening, perhaps we had better not begin, lest we should be obliged
to break off the thread of our argument at an unfavourable point.
But, though I have not investigated the important question which
we discussed when we accidentally met, yet I will do it. You see
the company which I keep (pointing to Mr. Lewellin and Mr. Newton)
is a proof that I am <em>religiously inclined</em>; and, if a few doubts
should still darken my powers of mental vision, yet the light which
emanates from their chaste reasoning may ultimately disperse them,
and we all <em>may</em> become believers together."</p>

<p>"A consummation I should hail with delight."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Sir; and I honour the motive which prompts such
a devout exclamation."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On passing along Cheapside on our way to the chapel which Mr.
Lewellin usually attended, we were astonished at seeing a placard,
announcing that the Rev. Mr. Guion was to preach that evening at
Bow Church, in behalf of the Church Missionary Society; and at
my earnest entreaty, we decided on hearing him. By a statement
he made at the commencement of his discourse, we found his appearance
in the pulpit was in consequence of the sudden illness of a
brother clergyman who stood engaged to preach on the occasion;
and this accounted for our not hearing of this London visit when we
were with him at Fairmount. Having my note-book in my pocket,
and my pencils in good working order, I took down his sermon, and
will transcribe from my manuscript a few passages, which, when
delivered, made a deep impression on the whole congregation. His
text was taken from 1 Tim. iii. 16, "And without controversy great
is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified
in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on
in the world, received up into glory." His arguments in confirmation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the divinity of Jesus Christ were few, but popular and conclusive,
yet not common-place.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">He was seen of Angels.</span>"&mdash;"Our knowledge," said the eloquent
preacher, "of angels is very superficial; yet we know, they are beings
of a superior order&mdash;holy, intelligent, powerful, and benevolent. Jesus
Christ was seen of them, at his birth, during his temptation in the
wilderness, when enduring the agonizing conflict in the garden of
Gethsemane, and on the morning of his resurrection; and they came to
witness, and to take a ministering part in his ascension, when he went
to resume the glory which he had with the Father before the world
was. This <small>SEEING</small> him, denotes the intense interest they felt in his
personal honour, and in the design of his mission to earth. 'Which
things,' says the apostle Peter&mdash;that is the sufferings of Christ and the
glory that should follow&mdash;'the angels desire to look into.' They pry
into and labour to comprehend the grand theory of human redemption;
and watch with intense solicitude its practical working in the soul
of man. Hence, our Lord says, 'There is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.' Yes, brethren, these
pure and exalted spirits become comparatively insensible to the
glories of the celestial world, when in the act of seeing a sinner who
is ready to perish, rescued from the fearful peril of his condition, as
we should become comparatively, if not absolutely insensible to the
grandest and most picturesque scenery of nature, if we stood on some
eminence, gazing on the heroine coming out of her father's cottage,
hastening to the frothy beach, springing into the fishing-boat, braving
the fury of the tempest and the wild uproar of the storm, to rescue
the shipwrecked mariners from a vessel sinking in the deep waters.
For it is a law of their nature, no less than of ours, that gratification
shall yield to sympathy, and that the sight of deliverance from fatal
danger, shall have a more gratifying effect on a sensitive and benevolent
heart, than the most brilliant and exciting scenes which can
be presented to the imagination, or to the senses;&mdash;thus demonstrating
by a process as certain as any undeviating law of the material
economy, that every order of being, except infernal spirits, have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
instinctive abhorrence of the disastrous crisis in the progress of suffering;
and that they feel an ecstasy of emotion which no sights of
grandeur or of beauty, and which no sounds of melody can excite,
when they behold an unanticipated deliverance from some horrifying
and fatal termination. There stands the poor criminal on the fatal
platform, and the minister of death is near him, making the necessary
arrangements for his execution; deep sympathy is expressed in every
countenance, many sighs are heaved, and many weep; the silent
prayer is offered up, and all are breathless, expecting the drop to fall
which is to hurl him with convulsive agonies into the other world.
But there is a momentary pause, as an act of homage to a stranger,
who very unexpectedly makes his appearance. This stranger, to
whom all the officials and the doomed man pay marked attention, is
also an official armed with power, not the power of death, but of life;
he is the herald of mercy; and with a loud voice proclaims his pardon.
The multitude, long absorbed in sympathetic grief, now raise
the shout of gladsome triumph, as they gaze on the once doomed
man, as he passes from the death of agony and infamy, to newness
of life; they revel in the excess of ecstatic bliss; and feel more joyful
in spirit over this one criminal saved from the horrors of an ignominious
death, than over a whole community of righteous persons
who were never involved in a sentence of condemnation.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">He was believed on in the World.</span>"&mdash;"The testimony of the
Bible, and the records of ecclesiastical history, attest this fact, Rev.
vii. 9, 10; <em>and he is still believed on in the world</em>. I know, brethren,
that many persons of refined taste, and exquisite delicacy of feeling,
greatly admire the character of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph
and of Mary; and they feel a deep interest in the perusal of his
history. Their imagination expands in reflecting on that magnificent
scene beheld by the shepherds of Bethlehem, when his birth
was announced by the angel of the Lord. His healing the sick in
the temple&mdash;his opening the eyes of blind Bartimeus&mdash;and his raising
the only son of the widow as the procession was moving to the
grave, has a fine effect on their sensibilities. The Transfiguration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of Tabor sheds a halo of glory around his Divine form, which
attracts and gratifies their love of the marvellous. They catch the
inspiration of a powerful sympathy on seeing him bathed in tears,
as he stands beholding in the distant vision the desolations coming
on the city of Jerusalem. And when they gather around his cross,
they feel intense regret, intermingled with no slight degree of astonishment,
that one so kind, so humane, and withal such a friend
to suffering humanity, should be so rudely and so cruelly treated, and
the falling tear bespeaks the sorrow of their heart. Now go amongst
these refined, these poetic, these sentimental believers in the Divine
origin of the Christian faith, with the blood of atonement, and what
consternation will you produce! They will soon evince a strange revulsion
of feeling; the term itself is harsh and unintelligible; it is the
jargon of the uncouth and the vulgar; the crucifix charms their sentimentalism&mdash;they
abhor the cross. Go and talk to them about the
necessity of believing in the Son of God to save them from perishing;
go and talk to them about joy and peace in believing, and about the
good hope through grace, and you will soon lose caste, and be sent
adrift amongst the wild fanatics of the age. They will bow down
and do homage to the Divine origin of Christianity&mdash;that ideal Christianity,
which takes its nature, shape, and hue from the creations of
their fancy; but let the Christianity of the New Testament come
before them in her simple form&mdash;pure and spiritual, breathing her
own spirit, speaking her own language, delivering her own precepts
and her own promises, advancing her own claims, and offering her
own celestial gifts, on her own humiliating and changeless conditions,
and they will treat her, as the Jews did her illustrious Author,
with contemptuous scorn; and would rather have her driven from
the face of the earth, than be enrolled as her devotees, or retained as
her advocates. Be it so. But this you regret, on <em>their account</em>, as
you know that they who believe not, will die in their sins and perish
for ever, even though superior intelligence be blended with the fascination
of the most distinguished accomplishments. And you also
regret this terrible calamity on your <em>own account</em>, as the pardoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
criminal necessarily feels an abatement of his joy when set free, by
knowing that others are left for execution. But you, Christian brethren,
believe on Him, and have the witness within. You believe
on Him, and love Him; and to you he is precious. You believe on
Him, and know that all is safe for time, safe in death, and safe for
eternity."</p>

<p>"Really," said Mr. Gordon, as we were walking away, "I am
almost tempted to believe in the truth of the Christian theory, on
two accounts&mdash;it brings us into such close contact with beings of a
superior order, so that in passing into the invisible world, we shall
find that we are known there; and then it gives such security to
the mind against the horrors of death." A sudden storm of heavy
rain prevented any reply to these half-serious, half-ironical remarks;
but on taking leave, as we were getting into our separate hackney
coaches, he added, "I will call to-morrow evening, after business
hours, and chat over those grave questions; and perhaps I can prevail
on Newton to accompany me. Have patience; I may become
a believer in the course of time."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE SCEPTIC'S VISIT.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_089.jpg" alt="J" width="100" height="106" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">J ust after Mr. Lewellin had left home, to meet a friend
on a matter of business, Mr. Gordon called, agreeably
to his promise on the previous day, and we spent the
evening together.</p>
</div>

<p>"I had a lucky escape yesterday," said Mr. Gordon, "but I did
not know of it till I took up the <cite>Times</cite> this morning."</p>

<p>"From what did you escape, Sir?"</p>

<p>"I had an engagement, for yesterday morning, to go with a pleasure
party on an excursion up the river, but I over-slept myself;
and it was well for me that I did so, for the boat upset, and I regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to say that a very excellent and accomplished lady, whom I much
admired, was drowned."</p>

<p>"As I was passing Blackfriars' Bridge, in going to Surrey Chapel,
I witnessed an accident such as that to which you refer."</p>

<p>"Indeed! It no doubt was the same, for it was just as they were
setting out from Blackfriars' stairs that the disaster happened; it
must have been an appalling sight!"</p>

<p>"It was, indeed, a harrowing sight; and I trust I shall never witness
the like again. I heard that the lady who was drowned was a
very interesting creature, and the only daughter of a pious father.
The tidings of her loss must have been a sad blow to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, her father is one of your way of thinking, and I believe
him to be a very worthy man."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him since the fatal accident?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I have no heart to visit such a house of mourning.
The fact is, I shall never be able to see him again, for I planned the
excursion, and induced his son and daughter to join it. This I now
regret; but regrets are useless things."</p>

<p>"Regrets do sometimes produce happy results, and I should think
that yours, just now, must be very keen."</p>

<p>"Indeed, they are intensely keen. It will be a long time before I
get over the impression this fatal accident has made on me."</p>

<p>"You should take it as a warning."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know how it is, but I never feel quite myself when
taking a Sunday excursion; I feel a little qualm of conscience, even
though I do not hold the Sunday in such reverence as you do. I
thought some time<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> ago that I had got over these qualms, but they
will come back at times in spite of me."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that your conscience does reprove
you when you profane the Sabbath, and I hope its reproofs will be
more severe than they ever have been. They may be your protection
against some fatal danger."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, if I do not mistake your meaning, you wish me to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
frightened into the adoption of religious habits. Is this a fair specimen
of your Christian charity?"</p>

<p>"The storm sometimes saves the vessel which might become a
wreck in the calm, as we heard in the sermon last evening; and I
assure you I should be highly gratified to see you agitated by a
salutary feeling of dread and perplexity regarding the state of your
soul, as I then should indulge a hope that you would 'flee from the
wrath to come,' and take refuge in the promises of the gospel."</p>

<p>"Well, I must confess that Mr. Guion is one of the most eloquent
preachers I ever heard. The conclusion of his sermon was truly
sublime; the congregation appeared to quail under its terror&mdash;a feeling
which by no means surprised me. There is, indeed, a fearful
terror in the words the <em>wrath to come</em>; and there was almost an irresistible
impressiveness in the look and tones of the preacher when
urging his audience to flee from it. I felt, just before he finished,
that I must take refuge in the promises of the gospel; but the internal
commotion soon subsided when I found myself beyond the
reach of his voice, though still I cannot forget it."</p>

<p>"Now, Sir, to be candid; is not the terror you felt, when listening
to the sermon we heard, and the abiding recollection of it, something
like an unconscious homage instinctively paid to the positive reality
of the Christian faith? for we can hardly suppose that you would
invest a mere fiction with such power of impression."</p>

<p>"Why, no; I can scarcely admit that. My idea is, that my present
feelings are merely the lingering influences of early religious
training, with its accompanying associations; and we all know that
such influences may subsist long after we have been led to form different
opinions in our maturer years."</p>

<p>"They live to admonish and to warn, as well as to chastise.
There <em>may</em> be a <em>wrath to come</em>. This you must admit, simply because
you do not know there is not; nor can you know, unless God is
pleased to tell you so. <em>Hence your scepticism needs a Divine revelation
to sustain it</em>&mdash;mere disbelief goes for nothing in settling such a
question."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I know there is great difficulty, and sometimes an impossibility,
in proving a negative; but one thing is absolutely certain&mdash;I
cannot compel myself to believe what you believe, any more
than you can compel yourself to disbelieve what I disbelieve."</p>

<p>"My belief has evidence to sustain it; but your disbelief has none.
And while your disbelief is accompanied by a feeling of uneasiness
and perplexity, my faith exerts a soothing influence, which keeps
my mind in perfect peace."</p>

<p>"Well, I admit that your faith does more for you than my disbelief
does for me; but I cannot believe what you do without impeaching
both the wisdom and the beneficence of the Deity. In other
words, the Deity must sink in my admiration before I can admit
the Divine origin of Christianity."</p>

<p>"But how so?"</p>

<p>"The eloquent preacher whom we heard last evening, when discoursing
on the expression in his text, <em>he was believed on in the world</em>,
advanced two distinct propositions, which he endeavoured to sustain
by arguments taken from your Scriptures. The first was, that <em>there
is salvation for the chief of sinners if they believe in Christ and
trust in him</em>. You believe and are safe, and are happy because you
expect to be saved. Now, I have no objection to advance against
this; because I know that faith, or trust in Him, does produce these
moral effects on true believers. But my nature revolts against his
second proposition, which was, <em>that none can be saved who do not
believe in Christ, and trust in him for salvation</em>."</p>

<p>"In sustaining those propositions the preacher said&mdash;and there is
great force in the remark&mdash;that we can have no assurance that any
will be saved but by a Divine testimony in proof of it; and that if
it please God to limit the exercise of his saving power to one prescribed
method, our objections against it will be altogether unavailing."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, you quote correctly. Now, in my opinion, it would be
a reflection on the wisdom and beneficence of the Deity to suppose
that he has bound himself under such a forced law of restriction as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
compels him to exclude all from a state of future happiness but the
few who do believe and do trust in Christ. Why, have we not
amongst us many men of unsullied honour, of princely generosity,
and of the most amiable dispositions&mdash;men who take the lead in
benevolent enterprises and social improvements&mdash;poets, philosophers,
historians, and statesmen, who are applauded in public, and
admired and esteemed in private life, but who cannot bow down
and do homage to Jesus Christ, by reposing an absolute dependence
on him for a hope of future blessedness, even though they unwillingly
pay an external homage to the regulations and institutions of
Christianity? Are men of such a high order of mind&mdash;of such brilliant
virtues&mdash;men who are the very life and soul of society&mdash;to be
cast off and left to perish along with the dissipated and the worthless?
It cannot be."</p>

<p>"Your objection, then, does not lie so much against the salvation
of the great sinners, who repent and believe in Christ, as it does
against the law of restriction, which excludes all who do not repent
and believe from the hope of salvation."</p>

<p>"I can admit your first proposition, without much difficulty, even
though I do not say that I actually believe it; but I cannot entertain
a belief that the Deity has enacted a law which restricts the
exercise of his beneficence to a select few, some of whom, on your
own admission, are more distinguished for their vices than for their
virtues."</p>

<p>"But is not the law of restriction, even now, a fundamental law
of God's administrative government? For example, are superior
intelligence, genius, or wealth, made common property&mdash;to be possessed
by men share and share alike? Do we not see that the few
surpass the many&mdash;that some are brilliant stars while others are
mere glowworms; and while some occupy stations of affluence and
grandeur, others are left without a settled home, or any of the comforts
of life?"</p>

<p>"Why, if we really do believe that we are living under the administrative
government of the Deity, then there is no denying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
existence of this restrictive law. Facts are stubborn things; those
you mention are strongly corroborative of your views. But it does
not necessarily follow that this law of restriction applies to our final
destiny, even though it may be applicable to our present condition
of existence."</p>

<p>"But this admission deprives you of the basis on which you rest
your argument, that a law of restriction would be a direct impeachment
of the wisdom and the beneficence of the Deity."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it does."</p>

<p>"If, then, facts compel us to admit that this law of restriction is
in full operation <em>now</em>, while we are on earth, surely we must admit
the possibility of its continuance in a future state of existence, without
impugning the wisdom or justice of the Deity?"</p>

<p>"I never enter on a discussion on the questions at issue between
us, without feeling compelled to do one of two things; and yet I
cannot bring my mind to do either. I must admit the truth of revelation
and its explanations, and this I cannot do; or I must abandon
myself to <em>universal</em> scepticism, and this I feel unwilling to do. But
I do confess that I feel it more easy to disbelieve than to believe.
However, waiving further reference to this difficulty, allow me to call
your attention to another point, which, if not more difficult than the
one we have just been discussing, assumes, at least in my estimation,
an aspect of great perplexity. Assuming then, for the sake of the
argument, that the Deity does restrict the bestowal of future happiness
to those who do believe and trust in Christ, could he not have
devised some other scheme for this purpose, and one equally perfect
and effective&mdash;one, in fact, less open to objections?"</p>

<p>"I will reply to your question by asking another. Could not
God have made a world different to the one in which we live&mdash;one
more congenial to our taste, and less exposed to those privations
and hardships to which we are often subjected, and which we sometimes
so much dread?&mdash;A world, for example, in which every convenience
and necessary should be placed within reach; the earth
producing spontaneously the supplies of corn and fruits necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for our subsistence&mdash;a sufficient supply of dew as a substitute for
rain with its discomforts&mdash;the purification of the air effected by
gentle breezes instead of by tempests and hurricanes&mdash;no diseases
to rack the body nor cares to harass the mind; a world, in fine, in
which universal happiness should prevail, and sorrow and toil be
unknown?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is no denying that the Deity could have done this."</p>

<p>"But God has not done it; and therefore to object to what he has
done, because we can imagine he could have done something better,
is as useless, as it would be childish. Now, suppose for a moment
some other plan of salvation had been devised, it would have been
to accomplish what is effected by the present scheme&mdash;namely, the
final happiness of man. The present scheme, then, answers the
beneficent purpose of its Author&mdash;another plan could do no more
than this; but it would be romantic to suppose that it could be so
arranged, in its various parts and modes of application, as to preclude
the possibility of any objections to it, when we well know it is
next to impossible to find any twenty men who all think alike even
on the most obvious facts. Christianity places before us two great
practical facts, in which our present safety and final happiness are
involved: first, there is a way to heaven or to a state of future
blessedness&mdash;this should excite our gratitude; there is only one
way&mdash;this should make us cautious, lest, through ignorance, prejudice,
or carelessness, we come short of so glorious a consummation."</p>

<p>"Your explanations, Sir, may be satisfactory to yourself, but they
are not so to me. Indeed, the more I think of it, the more I feel disinclined
to bow down and do homage to the Christian faith. Now,
for example, it is an indisputable historic fact that many ages
elapsed before Christianity was promulgated; and, during this long
period, what countless millions of human beings must, on your
hypothesis, have perished, without ever having had a chance of
being saved! Would the Deity have remained silent so long if he
had bound himself to your law of restriction&mdash;to save none but the
few who believe and trust in Christ for salvation?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"If Christianity, which is the completion of the original scheme
of salvation, was not promulgated till a comparatively late period in
the history of our world, yet the essential substance of it was known
from the earliest period of time. The apostle says, that Abel, the
first man who tasted the bitterness of death, offered his prefigurative
sacrifice in faith, which is a proof that he knew the way of salvation,
to be perfected by the death of the promised Saviour; and we may
fairly presume that what he knew, would be made known to his descendants,
from one generation to another. And the same apostle says,
when speaking of his Jewish ancestors&mdash;'For unto us was the gospel
preached as well as unto them; but the word preached did not profit
them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it' (Heb. iv. 2).
And Jesus Christ himself says&mdash;'Your father Abraham rejoiced to see
my day; and he saw it, and was glad' (John viii. 56). From the time
of Abraham to the actual coming of Christ, the clearest and fullest
revelations of this scheme of salvation were limited to Abraham's
descendants; but we can collect from the records of ancient history,
scanty as its materials are, sufficient evidence to prove, that amongst
the people of other nations it descended by traditional report and
testimony, from one generation to another, so as to leave them without
excuse, if they perished in their disbelief, or from their own
neglect of giving it due attention. At length they became so corrupt
and debased that they were left, as a judicial visitation from God, to
suffer the consequences of their depravity and impenitence (Rom. i.
21-25)."</p>

<p>"But what immense numbers of human beings must, on your
hypothesis, have perished during this long reign of ignorance and
moral corruption; and I do not see that the state of things is much
improved at the present time. Now, let us look at the case just as
it is. Christianity has been in existence and in active operation, so
you say, for nearly two thousand years; and yet how small is the
space on the surface of our globe which is illumined by what you call
her celestial light, in comparison with the vast regions which are
enveloped in moral darkness!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I admit it," I replied.</p>

<p>"But how will you reconcile such a tremendous state of things,
with the acknowledged wisdom and beneficence of the Deity?"</p>

<p>"You are aware, Sir, that we are often compelled to admit as indisputable
facts, what we cannot reconcile with the wisdom and
benevolence of God&mdash;as the slave-trade, for example, slavery as it
now exists in America, and the perpetration of murders, and other
social crimes."</p>

<p>"Very true, Sir; these are confounding facts. They often stagger
me."</p>

<p>"Permit me to say, that the arguments you adduce to disprove, if
possible, the truth of the Christian faith, and its practical utility,
are precisely those I would employ in proof of its Divine origin and
beneficial tendency. Going back to an early period of time, let us
consider some of the indisputable facts of history. The tribes of
Israel, we know, had been held for centuries as slaves in the land of
Egypt; and after their emancipation they went to reside in Palestine.
In most of those qualities which command the respect and admiration
of mankind, the Jewish nation was remarkably deficient. With
the exception of their sacred writings, their literature appears to
have been meagre in the extreme; no eminent philosophers, historians,
or orators adorn their annals, and the fine arts seem scarcely
to have had any existence among them. Compared with the Greeks
and Romans, and other nations of antiquity, they were barbarians;
and were spoken of in the language of scorn and contempt by their
more accomplished and renowned contemporaries. In <small>ONE</small> department
of knowledge, however, the despised Jewish people far surpassed
the haughty statesmen and polished sages of Greece and
Rome. They knew the only true God, and spoke of him in a style
corresponding with his greatness, his condescension, and his paternal
love. While the inhabitants of all other countries were abandoned
to the grossest and most abject superstition and idolatry, the Hebrews
alone adored one God, and alone appear to have possessed any
suitable ideas of the dignity and holiness of the Supreme Being;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and while the worship of the pagan divinities was licentious and
cruel, that of the God of the Jews was distinguished by its mildness
and purity. Here is a contrast which must be traced to some adequate
cause."</p>

<p>"The Jews most certainly, in this department of knowledge, claim
a just superiority over other ancient nations; but this may have been
owing to their isolation and their training."</p>

<p>"That I grant; but their isolation was a Divine arrangement, and
their training a Divine dispensation. They were separated from all
other people by the express command of the Lord their God; and
their teachers who trained them in this department of knowledge&mdash;the
knowledge of the only true God, and of the way of salvation,
proclaimed that God had made himself known to them by special
revelation."</p>

<p>"Yes, they said so, and I will admit that they believed it was so;
but as they were not infallible, they may have been mistaken."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir, any person of common sense can easily distinguish
between a discovery, and a communication as to matters of fact.
However, to account for their superior knowledge on these sublime
and recondite subjects, without admitting the correctness of their
own testimony,'that God spake to <em>their fathers</em>,' is absolutely impossible,
unless we believe&mdash;what would be an outrage on common sense
to imagine&mdash;that there is more acuteness in mental dulness than
in superior intelligence; and that an untutored people, while devoting
themselves chiefly to agriculture and the rearing of cattle, could
eclipse, by the grandeur and sublimity of their discoveries, a people
who has long enjoyed the highest degree of intellectual culture."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, your Scriptures prove that the Jews had amongst them
men of genius and of great mental power. Isaiah, for example, in
sublimity and lofty grandeur of conception and description, has no
superior in any age or country; and the pastoral odes of David
equal, if they do not surpass, anything we meet with in Pope or
Addison. As a legislator, Moses stands at the head of his order, and,
if my memory serves me, the great critic Longinus says he was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ordinary man; and, therefore, it is not a matter of such wonderment
that they made discoveries of the Deity which no other philosophers
ever made."</p>

<p>"But you forget that what you call their discoveries were inspirations,
which came upon them from the Source of all knowledge;
and to these inspirations they uniformly attribute their knowledge
of the only true God, and that scheme of salvation which he had
devised on behalf of man. And this belief was entertained by all
the tribes of Israel, not simply because their teachers said so, but
because, they confirmed the truthfulness of their testimony by signs,
and wonders, and divers miracles."</p>

<p>"And yet after all their novel and sublime discoveries in regard
to these all-important subjects, and after all the miraculous attestations
which you say were supplied in confirmation of their truthfulness,
we find that they apostatized from the worship of their
Deity, and relapsed again and again into idolatrous worship and
practices, and became corrupt and debased like the people of other
nations."</p>

<p>"That is very true, Sir; and the consequences resulting from their
apostasy supplies a very cogent argument in favour of my hypothesis.
While they adhered to the worship of the true God, and observed
the statutes and ordinances which he gave them, they were a united,
virtuous, and prosperous people; and, though few in number, they
were great in power. No invading force could subdue them, nor
could any adjoining country into which they carried their arms
withstand the shock of their assaults. But when they renounced
their allegiance to Him, and relapsed into idolatry, practising at the
same time the cruel and obscene rites of heathenism, they became
debased and corrupt like other pagan nations; and then, when the
protecting arm of the Lord their God was withdrawn, they fell an
easy prey to their enemies, who reduced them to a state of slavery
more galling to their national pride than that of Egypt. And, in further
confirmation of my argument, just let us look at the present
moral state of those countries which have not yet received and submitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to the authority of Christianity. There we find most triumphant
evidence in favour of the moral superiority of the Christian
system over every other at present existing in the world, in regard
to promoting the dignity and happiness of mankind. Without descending
to the gross idolatries of Fetichism, and other abject forms
of superstition, what is the social condition of nations where Mahometanism
or Buddhism is professed? and what, on the other
hand, is that of those countries, where Christianity has been established?"</p>

<p>"To you, Sir, who believe that the Deity restricts the bestowal
of a state of future blessedness to that comparatively small number
who believe in Jesus Christ, the condition of those nations where
Christianity is not established must appear truly appalling; but
to myself it presents no such painful aspect, because, as the Deity
has permitted this state of things to descend from one generation
to another, for such a series of ages, I believe he looks with an
<em>equal eye</em> of compassion and beneficence on all his offspring; and
that, <em>if there be a future state of blessedness in reserve</em>, he will discard
your law of restriction, and confer everlasting happiness on
all, without respect to their faith, or their religious rites and customs.
Hence I see no absolute necessity why you should embark
in that crusade of missionary enterprise and labour, which we heard
recommended and enforced with so much eloquence last evening;
for we are not sure that if such a transfer of homage, and change
in the mode of worship, could be effected, it would augment the
happiness of the people who are the subjects of it, or improve their
social habits and dispositions."</p>

<p>"I am rather surprised to hear you make these remarks; however,
without noticing all of them, I think I can convince you that on
some points you are labouring under a species of delusion, and that
I shall endeavour to point out. I proceed, then, at once, to real or
very probable matters of fact. A vessel, richly laden and scantily
manned, may sail up the Thames or the Clyde in perfect safety,
even if there are no weapons of defence on board; but if she were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to venture near the coast of some parts of the Indian seas, her passengers
and crew would run the risk of a contest for their lives and
liberty with the savages on shore. If a vessel should be wrecked
on the shores of the once savage, but now Christian islands of Tahiti
or Raratonga, its crew and passengers would be sure of a kind reception
from the natives; while, if a similar disaster should happen
on the shores of the Feejees or of Sumatra, they would run the risk
of being seized and devoured; or, if spared this fate, would be
compelled to live in degradation and misery. Here are striking
contrasts, amongst human beings who are endowed with the same
powers of intelligence and sympathy as ourselves; but to what
singular cause are these to be referred, unless it be to the influence
of the Christian faith, which, you doubt, will work no beneficial
change in the character and condition of man?"</p>

<p>"You strike home now, and I feel I must surrender. But still,
while the diffusion of Christianity may tend to tame the wild savage,
and make him more like a human being, I do not see any necessity
for your missionary labours amongst the Chinese or the Hindoos,
who are highly civilized, and, upon the whole, intelligent. Why
should any efforts be made to dispossess them of their religion,
with its rites and ceremonies, which they inherit from their forefathers?"</p>

<p>"I think that no compulsory efforts should be made to achieve
this end; but I presume you would not think it wrong that our
government should introduce the humane laws of Britain into all
her foreign dependencies?"</p>

<p>"Why, no; such a measure, I think, would be very advisable."</p>

<p>"I thank you for this admission in favour of the necessity of
Christian missions, especially to India, where cruelties are still
practised in broad day, such as we should be apt to regard as monstrous
inventions, fitted only to gratify a morbid appetite for the horrible,
were they not attested by faithful eye-witnesses. What think
you of this specimen? At the annual festival in honour of Muha
Div (the great god), many persons are suspended in the air by large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
hooks, thrust through the integuments of their backs,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and swung
round for a quarter of an hour, in honour of this deity; and often
over a slow fire. Others have their sides pierced, and cords are introduced
between the skin and ribs, and drawn backwards and forwards,
while these victims of superstition dance through the streets.
Others cast themselves from a stage upon open knives, inserted in
packs of cotton. Sometimes one of these knives enters the body,
and the poor wretch is carried off to expire. If an infant refuses
his mother's milk, it is often hung up in a basket on a tree, to be
devoured by the vultures. This is no criminal offence, as it would
be amongst us, but a ceremonial regulation of their faith. And in
India, the mother often sacrifices her first-born, to conciliate her
guardian deity in behalf of her unborn progeny. When the child
is two or three years old, she takes it to the river, encourages it to
enter, as though about to bathe it, but suffers it to pass into the
current of water, when she abandons it, and stands an inactive spectator,
beholding the struggles and listening to the screams of her
perishing infant."</p>

<p>"I would have all these cruel rites and ceremonies put down by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the force of law; which, of course, would supersede the necessity of
your missionary enterprise."</p>

<p>"As experience is a safe guide in the settlement of doubtful
questions, a reference to it, on the present occasion, will supply
palpable evidence that the labours of our missionaries in India
have been of great importance and value, both to the natives themselves,
and also to the government, by facilitating the introduction
and peaceable establishment of a humane policy. The history of
their labours proves that they were not visionary speculatists, but
sober-thinking men, who knew and realized the fact, that wherever
Christianity prevails it uniformly conduces to the progress of mankind;&mdash;that
it communicates that just manner of thinking upon the
most important subjects, which, extending its influence thence to
every department of speculative and moral truth, inspires a freedom
of inquiry, and an elevation of sentiment, that raises its disciples
immeasurably above the level of unassisted nature. This great
historic truth gave them confidence in the prosecution of their
herculean labours. Let me now notice what they have already
accomplished, and that without creating any popular disturbances
amongst the natives, thus falsifying the predictions of their opponents,
who, from the press and in both houses of parliament, were
accustomed to say, that the safety of our Indian possessions was
endangered by the presence of our missionaries there; and that our
Indian empire would be irrecoverably lost if any legislative measure
were introduced to suppress or control the superstitious customs
and rites of the natives. In the first place, the missionaries have
given us correct information on all matters relating to the Hindoos&mdash;their
worship, and its various ceremonies&mdash;their character, and
social habits; and thus, by an accumulation of authentic facts, they
have disproved the statements of our popular writers, that the Hindoos
are not only an intelligent, but a very virtuous people; and that
their religious rites and services, though novel and repulsive to Europeans,
are both chaste and humane. Since the missionaries exposed
this deception, which had been so long practised upon us, no one has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ventured to eulogize the virtues, or defend the religious practices of
the Hindoos. In the second place, they established schools for the
education of the youth of India, both male and female; and thus
they have succeeded, to a very considerable extent, in diffusing both
scientific and biblical knowledge, which is noiselessly but effectively
rescuing them from the dominion of the debasing ignorance and
superstition under which their forefathers had been living from
time immemorial. And no one doubts, who is at all conversant with
the present state of things in India, but the rising generation will far
surpass any preceding one, in mental acuteness, in knowledge, and in
moral character. In the third place, by their writings, their preaching,
and their intercourse with the natives, they have proved useful
pioneers in clearing the way for the peaceable introduction of the laws
promulgated by the British government for the suppression of many
of those cruel practices to which I have already alluded. In the
fourth place, without employing any undue modes of attack and
exposure, they have succeeded, to a very considerable extent, in
shaking the confidence of the Hindoos in the truth of their national
faith; and a powerful conviction is impressed on the Indian mind&mdash;an
impression which is becoming deeper and deeper every day&mdash;that the
days of their mythology are numbered, and that ere long its humiliation
and subversion will be achieved. And, in addition to these
proofs and indications of their success, I have to report another of
their triumphs, and that refers <em>to your own fraternity</em>&mdash;the conversion
of many of our own countrymen, who, on their settlement in
India, became first speculative, and then practical unbelievers&mdash;rejecting,
as visionary or fabulous, the faith of their early training,
and often distinguishing themselves by their virulent hostility to the
Christian missionary and his labours; but who now zealously co-operate
with him in his exertions to spread the knowledge of the
way of salvation."</p>

<p>"To you, these doings of your missionaries are splendid triumphs
in confirmation of the Divine origin of that faith, which restricts
the bestowal of a state of future blessedness to the comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
few who believe in Jesus Christ; but to me they appear nothing
more than the natural consequences of a well-concerted attack on a
long-established and nearly worn-out order of things, which we
know invariably results in dividing popular opinion. On all such
occasions <em>Divide and conquer</em> is the motto, and when this is done,
then the pruning off from the old stock of belief and opinion, and
the engrafting on the new one, is an operation as natural as it is
easy. Human nature is given to change; the love of it is an essential
element in our mental constitution, and nothing is more common
than going from one extreme to another, or more likely than the
change from Brahminism or Buddhism to the faith of Christianity."</p>

<p>"And from Deism to Christianity also, as I have shown you.
Hence, to quote your own words, I indulge the hope that you will
become a believer, if we have patience."</p>

<p>"A possible event, on the assumed correctness of your hypothesis,
as then I may be operated on by some Divine influence, which I shall
have no power to withstand; but on my own supposition, as remote
from possibility as the junction of the antipodes."</p>

<p>"We shall see. You have already advanced some way in the right
direction. But to return to India. Here is a fact, which was not
publicly known amongst us, till it was reported by our missionaries&mdash;that
one whole tribe in India has uniformly destroyed every female
child born amongst them, so that they have been obliged to take
their wives from the tribe next in rank to them. On one occasion a
father's heart recoiled when the emissaries of murder demanded
his daughter; and he repelled them from his presence. Her life was
spared, and she grew up tenderly beloved by her parents; but the
sight of a girl rising to maturity in the house of a Rajpoot, was so
novel, and so contrary to the customs of the tribe, that no parent
sought her in marriage for his son. The grief-worn father, suffering
under the frowns of his own tribe, and trembling for the chastity
of his daughter, and the honour of his family, bore her off to a pathless
desert, where, with his own hand, he slew her, leaving her body
to be devoured by wild beasts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horrid! horrid! Such transactions as these, if true and believed,
are enough to rouse popular indignation against our government
for not adopting some prompt and severe measures to prevent
their repetition. I would annihilate the whole tribe, rather than
suffer such inhuman monsters to live on earth."</p>

<p>"You then would recommend a wholesale massacre to save a few
lives; while I would advocate the introduction amongst them of a
pure and humane faith, which teaches and enforces the relative obligations
of parents and children as they prevail amongst ourselves.
This sense of relative obligation, and the social improvement which
necessarily follows it, Christianity, by its mild and persuasive influence,
has already succeeded in establishing in the cannibal islands
of the South Sea, and also, to some extent, amongst the natives of
civilized India. Christianity can do, and I have no doubt will do,
for India what she has done for Britain&mdash;subvert her idolatry, with
its cruel and obscene rites, and raise up an enlightened and renovated
native population, who, with gladsome voices, will sing the
song of Bethlehem, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good-will toward men' (Luke ii. 14)."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon, on rising to take his leave, said, "Well, there is
no denying the fact, that the world is in a sad disordered state; and
if you think you can improve it by your missionary labours, I will
not impeach the benevolence of your motives, though, without hesitation,
I may predict the failure of your sacrifices and exertions."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, you must acknowledge that it is more honourable to fail
in the cause of philanthropy than to make no effort."</p>

<p>"This honour, I believe, is in reserve for you, though I must say
you merit one more brilliant. Go on, my dear Sir; but don't be
too sanguine. Utopia I know is very rich in splendid scenery, but
unfortunately it partakes much of the nature of the mirage. Good
night; with many thanks for all your good wishes."</p>

<h2>A RENEWED ENCOUNTER.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_107.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The night before I left London, Mr. Gordon again
called, and, after some desultory conversation, our attention
happened to be directed to the book entitled
<em>No Fiction</em>, which was lying on the table. This led to
a somewhat sharp and lengthened encounter.</p>
</div>

<p>"I dipped into that book," said Mr. Gordon, "the other day, and
it gave me some amusement, as the tale is made to appear a very
natural one. Its author narrates and sketches extremely well, for
a divine, and it is highly creditable to his talents, which must certainly
be of a superior order."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, he is quite a superior man. There is one paragraph of
his tale to which I should like to direct your attention, and which,
by your permission, I will read to you."</p>

<p>"Read on, Sir, and I'll give all due attention."</p>

<p>I then read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have often been delighted," said Douglas, "in reading the
accounts of the power of religion on the minds of children; but this
is the <em>first</em> instance which has fallen beneath my own eye. What a
religion is ours! How great&mdash;and yet how plain! It is so sublime,
that it rises beyond the conception of the most enlarged mind! and
so simple, that it brings home its lessons to the bosom of a little
child! The elements of the gospel, like the elements of our nourishment,
are adapted to the endless varieties of age, and character, and
circumstance, throughout all the human race."</p>

<p>"And this appears," said Lefevre, "to be a feature in our religion
which distinguishes it from all false religions. As far as I am
acquainted with the subject, no one of the pagan systems <em>could</em> have
been rendered universal. They all received their character from
national prejudice, national policy, and predominant national vices."</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Douglas, "and as, in their own nature, they were
not adapted for the benefit of mankind as such, so their great
teachers discovered an indifference to the bulk of the human race,
incompatible with everything which deserves the name either of
religion or morality. With haughty pride they exulted in their
own wisdom, and looked down with scorn or ridicule on the folly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of those who were not initiated into their false philosophy. Man
scarcely deserved their notice, but as he claimed the proud titles of
rich, or wise, or noble; and women and children were utterly abandoned
to ignorance and wretchedness. Jesus, our blessed Saviour,
was the first Master in religion who opened the door of knowledge
<em>to all</em>&mdash;who carried his instructions and his tears to the cottage of
<em>the poor</em>! This appears to me to involve a powerful evidence of
the truth of Christianity, that may well perplex and confound the
hosts of infidelity. I have more than once thought that the psalmist
must have referred to this use of the subject, when he said, 'Out of
the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and
the avenger.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>"This passage, if I remember rightly," Mr. Gordon remarked,
"refers to a tale very similar to your story of <em>The Woodman's
Daughter</em>; but I must confess, with all due deference, that I see
nothing very remarkable in it; and how you can think of adducing
it as an argument in favour of the Divine origin of Christianity,
rather surprises me. Children, we know, are imitative. They take
the manners, the habits, and the tones of their parents and teachers;
and if they should adopt their sentiments, feelings, and expressions,
it certainly ought not to be considered remarkable. But yet I
should like to hear how you contrive to connect such a fact and
the divinity of the gospel together."</p>

<p>"Such a fact, Sir, proves that the Christian religion is adapted
(as we may fairly presume it would be, if of Divine origin), to the
moral condition of man, irrespective of his age&mdash;of the strength or
weakness of his intellect&mdash;or the peculiar shades of his moral character.
To suppose that this adaptation is by accident, would be no
less objectionable than to conclude, with the sceptics of the French
school, that it is by chance we see, hear, and speak. If you are
prepared to admit that the marks of contrivance, which we can
easily discover in the construction and organization of our senses,
supply us with a legitimate argument in favour of the existence of
a God, by whose power and wisdom this organization has been
arranged, I cannot conceive how you can avoid admitting the
marks of contrivance which we can as easily trace in the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
scheme of salvation, as conclusive evidence in favour of its Divine
origin."</p>

<p>"O Sir! it has been invented by a few crafty men, who wished to
display their skill at the expense of our credulity, and they have
done it most dexterously. They were certainly adepts in invention."</p>

<p>"I know that this is a favourite opinion with you Deists; but I
do not think that you can support it. How came these men to
devise a scheme of religion which is so admirably adapted to the
moral state of man? From whence did they gain their information?
They tell us that they wrote under the dictation of an infinitely
wise Spirit, and, in common fairness, their testimony ought to be
admitted; and, I think, a candid examination of what they have
done, and the style in which they have done it, will satisfy us that
they are truth-speaking men. I form my judgment on this point
as I should on another somewhat analogous to it. If, for example,
I saw an epic poem equal to that of Virgil or Milton, or a treatise
on logic superior to that of Dr. Watt's, written by a boy of ten
years of age; and, if on expressing my astonishment and admiration,
he should say&mdash;'The writing, Sir, is mine, but nothing more&mdash;I
wrote from the dictation of Wordsworth and Whately,' I should
at once believe him, from a consciousness of his incompetency to
produce such compositions by his own unaided powers. So with
the sacred writers. We know that, with very few exceptions, they
were unlearned and ignorant men, and their contemporaries who
knew them spoke of them as such; and yet they have surpassed
all other men in the science of moral and spiritual truth. In confirmation,
too, of this internal evidence of the truthfulness of their
testimony, that they wrote under the dictation of an infallible Spirit,
we find, on examination, that the various parts of their comprehensive,
yet minute theory, are in perfect harmony with each other, while,
at the same time, the theory itself is admirably adapted to the moral
condition of humanity. The marks of contrivance are too obvious
to allow us to refer the arrangements to chance, or the mere skill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
man. For our guilt, it provides a propitiatory sacrifice, whose blood
cleanses from all sin&mdash;for our depravity, it provides a renovating
influence, by which, we are made partakers of the purity of the
Divine nature; regarding us as oppressed with cares and sorrows,
it animates us with exceeding great and precious promises, by which
we are enabled to put our trust in God, and thus rise above the
trials of this life; and, viewing us as panting for immortality, it
unveils futurity, and delights us with the sublime vision of endless
happiness."</p>

<p>"To you, who are initiated into a firm belief of the Divine origin
of Christianity, this apparent adaptation of it to our moral condition
and necessities, and its revelations of a future state of happiness,
must appear as the consummation of wisdom and benevolence.
But I cannot resist the impression, that it is to the activity of your
imagination you ought to attribute this correspondence, rather than
to any actual fact; and that you are, at least so I think, unconsciously
beguiling yourself with pleasing anticipations which will all
prove visionary."</p>

<p>"The gospel, Sir, is a living reality, and it works moral wonders."</p>

<p>"I don't quite comprehend your meaning."</p>

<p>"I mean, that it answers the purpose for which it was intended,
or, in other words, it does the moral work which is ascribed to it,
and does it effectually; this I can prove by an appeal to living testimony.
Hence, when it is received by faith, it <em>does</em> give peace to a
wounded conscience; it <em>does</em> infuse a renovating power, by which
man becomes a new creature, in his moral principles and social
habits; it does administer the most soothing and strengthening consolation
to the child of sorrow, and it animates the dying believer
with the hopes of a blissful immortality. These are moral facts
which the experience of myriads can attest."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see how it is; the imagination traces a correspondence
between its own impulses, and aerial flights, and the component
parts of your scriptural theory; and you very naturally think that
you would be robbed of an inestimable treasure, and the world at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
large sustain an irreparable loss, if your theory of faith should
be exploded as a worn-out relic of an antiquated superstition."</p>

<p>"But, after all you say against the Christian faith, I do not think
you would vote for its expulsion from the earth, even if you thought
you could succeed in effecting it; and I will tell you why. Its
expulsion would be as great a calamity to the moral world, as the
total disappearance of the solar light would be to the physical&mdash;we
should at once relapse into a state of profound ignorance on all the
important questions which relate to God, to our origin, our immortality,
and our destiny. We should then find ourselves groping
about, like the ancient heathen, amidst vain and foolish speculations,
striving to unravel the mysteries of our nature, and finding
no resting-place for our troubled spirits. I have often thought, when
musing on such a fearful occurrence, what an awful gloom would
spread over the world if we knew that the fatal hour was coming,
when, by some supernatural process, all our knowledge of Jesus
Christ, and the design of his mission and death, would suddenly
pass away from human recollection; and when every leaf in our
Bible, and of all other books referring to him, should become as
blank as they were before they were printed&mdash;leaving us, like the
doomed spirits of the infernal world, without a Saviour, or any promise
of mercy."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> would anticipate such a strange event with sad and awful
forebodings. The disappearance of Jesus Christ from your theory
of belief would be to you, and to all of your way of thinking, an
irreparable calamity; though I must confess, that I cannot account
for the hold he keeps on your imaginations. To me, this is a mystery
which deepens in profundity the more I try to fathom it. His
very name appears to be a charm, and of more than magic power."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Gordon, there is a charm in the name of Jesus, which
at all times, but more especially under circumstances of great privation
and danger, both soothes and elevates his disciples. They fear
not to die in the tranquillity of their own homes or the raging of
the tempest, on the scaffold or the battle-field."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not attempt to deny a fact which general testimony confirms;
but permit me to ask, if you can assign any rational cause for
what appears to me so mysterious?"</p>

<p>"I can; the fact admits of a fair explanation. Those who have
faith in Christ believe that, though invisible, He is ever near them
to succour and to comfort them. Hence, the sailor, when pacing the
deck during the dark and stormy night, prays to <span class="smcap">Him</span>, who, when
sailing with his disciples, rebuked the winds and the waves; and
he feels that he is addressing one who hears him, and can save him.
Yes! and in the dreary cell of tyranny&mdash;at the stake of martyrdom&mdash;in
penury, suffering, and in death&mdash;the name of Jesus is uttered
with thrilling accents, and awakens associations which have tenfold
greater power over the soul than the kindest expressions of human
sympathy and love. I was an eye-witness, not long since, to a display
of Christian heroism in death:&mdash;A young man, of superior intelligence
and station in life, who had been rather sceptically inclined,
was taken ill, and during his continued illness his sceptical notions
vanished, and he became a simple believer in Christ Jesus. After
the lapse of some months, his physician told him he must die, as his
disease was beyond the reach of human skill. I was present when
this announcement was made, and he received it without expressing
either surprise or regret. When his medical attendant withdrew,
he said to his mother and his sisters, who stood weeping by his bedside&mdash;'I
am not surprised by your tears, for I know you love me;
but weep not for me, for I am nearing the end of my course. My
confidence of a glorious issue is placed on <span class="smcap">Him</span>, who is mighty to
save; he is with me, though I see him not. Death's dark vale is
illumined with the light of life, and I shall soon pass through it, and
then I shall be safe and happy for ever.'"</p>

<p>"Most marvellous! and yet I believe it. Such incidents as these
are most impressive. We are mysterious beings, alternately terrified
by our own imaginary fears, and excited to ecstasy by the illusions
of our own fancy."</p>

<p>"But the extinction of Christianity and its sacred records might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
prove a great disaster to you sceptics; especially at some of the
turning points of your history."</p>

<p>"To us! you now really take me by surprise; but, to be serious,
how do you make this out?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is well known that sceptics, when in expectation of
death, often call on Jesus Christ to save them."</p>

<p>"A drowning man will catch at a straw."</p>

<p>"He would prefer a life-boat."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>"I ask you one plain question&mdash;If you lived on a dangerous coast,
would you ever scuttle a life-boat which has rescued many from
destruction, and which possibly you may live to need?"</p>

<p>"I see your drift, and admire your ingenuity. Of course, I would
not."</p>

<p>"Well, I will venture on another supposition, and leave you to
decide whether I am not right in my conjectures, that even you, with
all your antipathies to Jesus Christ, may be surprised in circumstances
which would render the sound of his name the most effectual
solace that could be given. Suppose, for instance, we were walking
together in some vast forest in the far northern part of America,
and saw advancing toward us a band of apparently ferocious savages,
should we not tremble with fear and apprehension? But
suppose, while in this state of terror, we should hear them singing
in chorus a verse of some familiar hymn, would you then recoil
in terror? Would you experience additional consternation on perceiving
that these barbarians had been instructed in the Christian
faith?"</p>

<p>"I like your illustrations&mdash;they amuse me. Can't you favour me
with another?"</p>

<p>"I will try. Suppose you were sailing among the islands of the
South Seas, and, when nearing one of them, would you not rather see
the natives on the beach clothed in European dresses, as at Tahiti
and Raratonga, than in a state of savage nudity? and would you
hesitate to drop anchor if you heard them singing in harmony&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Jesus shall reign where'er the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does his successive journeys run:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till moons shall wax and wane no more.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"In arguing," said Mr. Gordon, "there is nothing more desirable
than a good illustration, which gives pleasure, even when it does not
produce conviction. Well, then, I will admit that there is a strange
fascinating power in a name, and in mental associations, for which
our most sagacious philosophers are unable to account; but that's
no reason why I should give it my sanction, if I believe, as I do in
these cases, that it springs out of a superstitious belief; and, therefore,
leaving the sailor in the storm, and the prisoner in the cell,
with the rest of your illustrative examples, and not caring to conjecture
how I should act or feel if I were placed in such circumstances
as you describe, I certainly, according to my present views and impressions,
would vote for the expulsion of Christianity, if my suffrage
could bring about such an event; but I fear that it is too deeply
fixed in the prejudices of the public mind ever to be rooted up&mdash;at
least in our time."</p>

<p>"But would you not tremble in anticipation of the success of
such an effort? Expel Christianity from the earth! Why, what
evil has she done? You may trace her progress by the improved
condition of the people whom she has visited and blessed. Where
she finds a wilderness, she leaves a fruitful field for the sickle of
the husbandman; she meets with briars and thorns, and converts
them into the myrtle tree and the rose; she encounters all the
base lusts and ferocious dispositions of our nature, and supplants
them with the tranquillizing affections of purity and peace. She
improves the intellect, refines the taste, and humanizes the character;
and, by raising men to a state of spiritual communion with
the Supreme Being, imprints on them the image of his benevolence,
and animates them with his love of righteousness. She mitigates
the violence of sorrow&mdash;binds up the wounds which adversity inflicts
in the heart of man&mdash;reconciles the mourner to his bitter loss&mdash;disarms
death of his terrors&mdash;and exhibits beyond the grave a scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of tranquillity and of joy which no hand can portray or tongue
describe. Expel Christianity from the earth! Then, Sir, you would
give perpetuity to those horrid systems of idolatry which maintain
their dominion over the great majority of the human race, as no
power will ever destroy them but that which the gospel of Christ
displays. Nay, Sir; if you were to succeed, you would prove the
greatest enemy to man that ever visited the earth since the author
of all evil triumphed over our first parents: for how many thousands
would you, by such a wanton act of cruelty, deprive of their sweetest
sources of consolation, and their brightest prospects of happiness!"</p>

<p>"You are eloquently severe; but, my dear Sir, you may spare
your severity, as it is not likely that I shall ever make the attempt,
and less likely that I should succeed, were I vain, or, to quote your
own language, wanton and cruel enough to do it. I willingly admit
that Christianity has done some good, but you must allow that she
has done some evil; and it is but fair to balance the one against the
other, to see which preponderates. If she has promoted peace in
one country, she has planned massacres in others; if she has blessed
one family, she has introduced discord and division into others; and
if there are a few solitary individuals animated by her promises of
mercy, there is a larger number who tremble under the awful denunciations
of her vengeance."</p>

<p>"Her promises of mercy are addressed to all, and all are invited
to receive the blessings which she is willing to bestow; but if they
disdainfully reject them, and treat her message of grace with contempt,
she turns away, and announces their approaching doom; and
she does this in a tone, and with a lofty majesty of speech, which
often makes the most daring quail before her. But why do they
tremble, if they believe she has no power to punish? Your other
charges against her I will meet by a quotation from a book<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which
I wish you would peruse, and which I shall be happy to present to
you:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"That men calling themselves Christians have persecuted others
with unrelenting cruelty, and have shed rivers of innocent blood, is
but too true. Did Christianity countenance this conduct, it would
merit unqualified reprobation. But far from such a disposition, it
forbids all violence and injury to be employed in its defence. Christianity
never shed a drop of its enemies' blood since the day that
Christ died on the cross; but it has been lavish of its own. It never
forged a chain to bind a heretic or an adversary, nor erected a
prison to immure him. Christianity never dipped her pen in tears
of blood, to write a penal law denouncing vengeance on infidels.
She never made her bitterest foe heave a groan, from any bodily
suffering inflicted by her hands. Her only weapons of offence and
defence are truth and prayer. She returns good for evil, and blessing
for cursing.</p>

<p>"If men, wearing the garb of the disciples of Jesus, instigated by
pride, and the lust of dominion, and a desire to gratify the worst
passions of the human heart, injure any of the human race under a
pretence of zeal for religion, they act in direct opposition to the
gospel, and you cannot condemn them with too much severity. But
surely Christianity should not be condemned for what it forbids men
to perpetrate under pain of the Divine displeasure. Or if such as
were truly Christians ever sought to put a stop to infidelity or error,
and to propagate the gospel in the world by force (and it is to be
deplored with tears of blood that such there have unhappily been),
they will receive no more thanks from Christ than the three disciples
when they wished him to bring down fire from heaven to
destroy the Samaritans:&mdash;'Ye know not what manner of spirit ye
are of: the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save
them.' Nor would he account the words, which he directed to Peter
on a different occasion, too severe to be used to them here:&mdash;'Get
thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence unto me; for thou savourest
not the things which be of God, but the things which be of men.'
Both the principles and precepts of the gospel, and the conduct of
Christ and his apostles, are as remote from persecution as the east
is from the west."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I admire the candid and amiable spirit of the writer, and will
certainly read his book, if only from respect to the friendship
which dictates the present; but I will not flatter you with any
hope of bringing me over to your belief. However, waiving all
personal remarks, allow me to ask you if you really believe that
Christianity will ever become a universal religion? and, if so, how
do you think it will be propagated through the earth?"</p>

<p>"That it is <em>adapted</em> to become a universal religion, no one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
doubt who has ever inquired into its nature and design, or who has
ever read the history of its progress. It is suited to man as a rebellious
subject of the Divine government; and it has been embraced
by men of every rank, of every clime, and of every description of
character. Hence, if you could bring together, in one place, some natives
of Europe, Africa, Asia, and America, or from any of the islands
or cities which belong to either of these great divisions of the earth;
and could, by some miraculous influence, impart to them the power
of speaking the same language, you would find them all, if they had
embraced the pure faith of Christ, giving utterance to the same
sentiments&mdash;expressing the same feelings&mdash;exulting in the same
prospects&mdash;and disclosing all the peculiarities of the same singular
and extraordinary spiritual character."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, if this hypothetical statement be correct, how will you
account for the endless divisions which prevail amongst those who
are known to embrace the same Christian faith?"</p>

<p>"You ought, Sir, to distinguish between a real and a nominal
Christian; and though I will not deny but there are diversities of
opinion even amongst real Christians, yet they relate to minor and
subordinate questions. Consider Christianity as coming from God&mdash;it
is pure and unspeakably good; view it as received by men&mdash;it
will be, as the schoolmen say, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum modum recipientis</i>. If the
difference of capacity, and the prejudices and passions of mankind be
duly weighed, we shall not account it strange if they do not all
think alike, nor receive the truth in all its purity. But this is
not peculiar to the Christian religion. There are divisions and
dissensions in matters of religion among pagan idolaters, among
Mahometans, and among Deists. You cannot deny it. But the
Deist does not consider this as a reason for rejecting Deism. If so,
neither is it a reason for rejecting Christianity. More particularly,
some men are destitute of every noble principle&mdash;they are full of
deceit, avarice, pride, and sensuality. We see them abuse the gifts
of nature, and of Providence; is it wonderful, then, if they pervert
Christianity too, and entertain different ideas of many of its doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from wise and godly men? It is no more an objection against
Christianity being from God, because such persons come short of
its purity, than against the gifts of nature and other temporal blessings
being from God, because they are often abused. Weakness of
intellect will produce peculiarities of sentiment on every subject,
and, consequently, on religion. The prejudices of education and
early habits will generate attachments to certain opinions and rites;
hence, also, differences in religion will arise; but the fault is not in
Christianity, it is in man. From similar causes we see a diversity of
opinion among the learned regarding sciences of great utility&mdash;medicine,
law, politics, philosophy; but, notwithstanding this, all allow
them to be highly beneficial to mankind&mdash;none deny their usefulness,
although people differ about some particular points. To reject the
gospel, because bad men pervert it, and weak men deform it, and
angry men quarrel about it, displays the same folly as if a person
should cut down a useful tree because caterpillars disfigured its
leaves, and spiders made their webs among its branches."</p>

<p>"I have no objection at present to offer to this fair explanation of
the difficulty which has often perplexed me; but you will permit me
to refer you to my former question&mdash;Do you think that Christianity
will ever be universally established?"</p>

<p>"I do, Sir; and my belief is founded on the following basis.
Christianity is adapted for a universal religion; it foretells the fact
of its universal establishment; its disciples are commanded by the
Lord Jesus Christ to seek its universal propagation; and it is now
spreading itself with unexampled rapidity through the nations of
the earth. You cannot, Sir, but be conscious that the aspect of the
times indicates some approaching change in the destinies of man;
and though you, on your principles, cannot hail any redeeming power
by which the curse that inflicts such mighty evils on suffering
humanity can be rolled away, yet we can on ours; and hence, while
you are left to speculate on the charms of a philosophy which has
never ameliorated the moral condition of man, we can speak with
confidence of the intervention of <em>Him</em>, who will turn the curse into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a blessing, and make this earth the abode of purity, of harmony, and
of bliss."</p>

<p>"But how do you expect this great and mysterious change to be
brought about?"</p>

<p>"Not by force. That has been tried by short-sighted rulers in
former times, and has utterly failed. Conversion to Christianity
which is effected by such means produces no change in the human
heart. The <em>man</em> remains the same, though his professed belief may
vary. The circulation of the Scriptures, the distribution of religious
treatises, and the preaching of the gospel, are the only means which
we employ to accomplish this great design. But, even when these
means are used in the most judicious manner, we do not calculate
on accomplishing the purpose which we have in view without the
influence of a supernatural co-operation; for it is not by the power
of man that the demon of superstition, or the Moloch of idolatry is
to be dethroned, and Christianity established, but by the Spirit of
the Lord."</p>

<p>"I rather admire your dexterity in avoiding, <em>on principle</em>, the
mortification attendant on any failure in your pious efforts in behalf
of the perishing heathen."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you."</p>

<p>"Why, you say, your success is dependent on the concurrence of
a supernatural power; and, consequently, if you fail in your pious
undertaking, you lay the blame on the inactivity of this supposed
preternatural influence, never for a moment doubting your own
sagacity, or questioning the efficacy of the means which you employ."</p>

<p>"If you examine the theory of the Christian faith, you will find
that, in every moral operation, this concurrence of supernatural
power with human agency forms an essential part of it. 'Man sows
the seed of truth, it is God who gives the increase.'"</p>

<p>"As such a theory must tend to limit exertion, and depress an
ardent mind, it strikes me that it is an ingenious invention to provide
a pleasant solace in the season of disappointment, which, I believe,
has its periodical visitations in your ecclesiastic annals."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has analogy in its favour. We eat and drink to sustain life,
but the efficacy of the nourishment to sustain life depends on God.
The farmer casts the seed into the soil, but it is God who causes it
to grow and yield its increase. His confidence in God gives a stimulus
to his own exertions."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't dispute this point with you; but, after all, does
it not tend to discourage your pious exertions, when you believe that
a successful issue is dependent on an influence which you cannot
control, and over which you have no power?"</p>

<p>"No. It has a contrary effect, as in the case of the husbandman.
We look upon ourselves as mere active instruments employed in accomplishing
the Divine purpose of grace and mercy in behalf of the
perishing heathen; and the established law of the economy of our
faith and practice is embodied in the following record of inspiration:&mdash;'For
as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth
not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring
forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the
eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it
shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I
please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. For ye
shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains
and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the
trees of the field shall clap their hands' (Isa. lv. 10-12)."</p>

<p>"I bow before such an ingenious theory of faith; but still entertain
my doubts. Patience must still hold on, or you will abandon
me in despair."</p>

<p>"I will continue to hope, even against hope; because I know there
is an unseen power which is capable of effecting such a transformation,
as I devoutly trust may yet be accomplished in you."</p>

<h2>THE EFFECT OF A WORD SPOKEN IN
SEASON.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="N" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Not long after I had returned home, and was again
busily engaged in my pastoral duties, I received a
letter, informing me of the last illness and death of
an esteemed friend and occasional correspondent, Mrs.
Hastings. Her history is an interesting one, and aptly illustrates
the effect of a word spoken in season.</p>
</div>

<p>"You must often," says Dr. Chalmers, "have been sensible, in the
course of your history, how big, and how important the consequences
were, that emanated from one event, which in itself was insignificant&mdash;how
on the slightest accidents the greatest interests were suspended&mdash;how,
moving apparently at random, you met with people,
or with occasions, that gave rise, perhaps, to far the most memorable
passages in your life&mdash;how the very street in which you chanced to
move, brought you into contact with invitations and appointments,
or proposals of some sort, which brought results of magnitude along
with them; insomuch that the colour and direction of your whole
futurity have turned on what, apart from this mighty bearing, would
have been the veriest trifle in the world. A word&mdash;a thought&mdash;an
unforeseen emotion&mdash;an event of paltriest dimensions in itself&mdash;may
be the germ of an influence wide as a continent, and lasting as a
thousand years&mdash;may, in fact, change the current and complexion
of a person's social history and character, and lead to consequences
which shall be durable as eternity."</p>

<p>Many years ago, I was unexpectedly called to London, on a matter
of great emergency. My travelling companion, for part of the way,
was a lady, attired in deep mourning. I endeavoured to draw her
into conversation, by referring to the beautiful scenery, and other
common-place topics, but I could not succeed. At length, on seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
her drop a tear, which she endeavoured to conceal, I said, "This
world is rightly denominated a valley of weeping."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, it is," replied the stranger. "I hope you will excuse
my weakness. I have sustained the greatest loss that can ever
befall a woman. I am a widow. I had one of the best of husbands;
but cruel fate tore him from me, even without permitting me to see
him, till his corpse was rudely exposed before me."</p>

<p>She then told me that her husband left her early one morning
to go out shooting, but, on passing through a hedge, it is supposed,
the trigger of his gun got entangled in the briars, as he was found,
an hour after the report had been heard, lying on his face, with his
gun by his side, and his dogs crouching before and behind him, as
though their master was asleep.</p>

<p>"Since that fatal hour, Sir, I have not had one pleasant feeling
in my desolate heart; and now I have left a spot on which nature
has lavished her beauties, to seek a tranquil death in some distant
shade."</p>

<p>"But, Madam, do you never expect to see another happy day?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir, never! No, never! I have tried every expedient in
my power, but they have all failed. I have been to Bath, to Cheltenham,
to Brighton, and have travelled on the Continent. I have
read the most popular novels of the English and the French schools;
but all is useless&mdash;mine is a hopeless case."</p>

<p>"No, Madam, it may not be hopeless. I can direct you to a source
of consolation which you have not yet thought of."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir; then I'll try it. I would freely part with wealth
for mental ease; for wealth, without happiness, is but an aggravation
of misery."</p>

<p>"I would recommend you, Madam, to read the Bible. That book
was composed for the express purpose of promoting our happiness;
and if you read it with attention, and pray for wisdom to understand
it, and for a disposition to receive the truths which it reveals, you
will find that it will do you more essential good than all the expedients
which you have been trying."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"If, Sir, I had not received a favourable impression of your benevolent
disposition, I really should imagine that you were disposed
to turn my intense grief into ridicule. Read the Bible! Why, Sir,
what is there in that obsolete book to interest me?"</p>

<p>"No, Madam; the book is not obsolete, and never will be, as long
as human misery abounds in the world. That book has healed
wounds as deep as yours, and mitigated sorrows no less poignant;
and, if you examine it, you may find it as a well-spring of life to your
withered happiness."</p>

<p>"Your advice, Sir, is prompted, I have no doubt, by the kindest
sympathy; but my heart instinctively recoils from adopting it."</p>

<p>"Why, Madam?"</p>

<p>"Because I cannot conceive how the reading of a book, which I
have always regarded as a collection of legendary tales, can remove
or assuage such sorrows as wring my spirit. I have neither faith
nor taste for such reading."</p>

<p>"Have you ever read the Bible, Madam?"</p>

<p>"O no, Sir, never! I may have read some passages as a school
lesson, but I don't remember any. My mother died when I was
but a little girl. From what I have heard an old servant say, I
believe that she was fond of the Bible; but my father abhorred it,
and he trained me to abhor it. He used to call it the Grand Mogul
of superstition. Its style of composition, I have heard him say, is as
offensive to correct taste, as its sentiments are revolting to a cultivated
mind."</p>

<p>"If you will permit me, Madam (taking out my little pocket Bible
while speaking), I will read you a few passages, and then you can
judge how far your belief is supported by evidence."</p>

<p>She bowed assent, and I then read the twenty-third psalm. I saw,
by the expression of her countenance, that the chaste imagery of the
psalmist pleased her; but before we could interchange any remarks
the horn blew, and the mail suddenly stopped. However, when she
alighted to step into the carriage which was in waiting to receive
her, she said, in a tone of subdued seriousness, "I will follow your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
advice, Sir, and read the Bible to form my own judgment of its
character and tendencies; and if you will favour me with your card
(which I gave her) I may, possibly, some day let you know the
result, especially if it should be what, I do not doubt, you wish it
may be."</p>

<p>A long period had elapsed after this occurrence took place, and
it had nearly passed from my recollection, when it was very unexpectedly
revived by a letter from the lady. The letter was subscribed
Susannah Hastings, and, after calling to remembrance the
circumstances in which we had met, she proceeded to give me a
general outline of her subsequent history, accompanied by an interesting
account of her severe mental conflicts in her spiritual inquiries,
and a pressing invitation to call and see her, should I ever pay
a visit to London, where she then resided. I acknowledged the receipt
of the letter, congratulated her on the great moral and spiritual
change through which she had passed, and stated that she might
expect to see me very soon. Not long after that I had occasion to
be in London. Within a few days after my arrival, I called on
her, and had from her own lips a more detailed account of the process
of her conversion from darkness to light, than she had given
me in her letter. My visits were repeated during my sojourn there,
and since then we kept up an occasional correspondence. From
these two sources of information&mdash;her letters and her verbal communications&mdash;I
am able to give a finished sketch of her somewhat
marvellous, if not romantic history.</p>

<p>Having entertained, from early childhood, a belief that the Bible
was a very objectionable book, both in point of sentiment and
style of composition, she says, in her first letter, "I was not only
surprised but delighted, by your reading the twenty-third psalm.
I saw the rural scene vividly depicted; the sheep feeding in the
green meadows, while the shepherd was reclining on the bank of
the gently flowing stream, watching the glad movements of the
sportive lambs, as the evening sun glided in noiseless splendour
through the sky. I at once resolved to purchase a Bible, thinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
<em>then</em>, that it was merely a work of the imagination&mdash;an antique relic
of some early poetic age." But on her arrival in London, she was
prevented from doing this so soon as she intended, in consequence
of the assiduous attentions of her friends, who were ceaseless in their
efforts to raise her drooping spirits; naturally thinking that, if they
could succeed in doing so, she would get reconciled to her fate, and
again enjoy life. Hence she was lured from one gay scene to another
still more exciting, and every expedient was adopted which ingenuity
could devise, to amuse and gratify her. But she soon found,
that neither the opera, nor the theatre, nor the fascinations of
private parties, could assuage the tumultuous agitations of her heart.
"I moved amongst them," she said, "more like an automaton than
a living being who felt any pleasure in existence."</p>

<p>An incident now occurred, that led her into a new train of
thought, which proved the beginning of an eventful issue in the
history of her life. On passing her bookseller's, she looked in, to
inquire about a new novel, which she had seen announced as just
issued from the press. There she saw on the counter a small Bible,
which brought our conversation in the stage coach to her remembrance,
and she purchased it. In her first letter, she says, "I soon
found the twenty-third psalm, and as I re-perused it, its poetic
imagery appeared to my mind more beautiful than ever. I then
turned to Psalm ciii., which I read with more solemnity of feeling.
It made me think of myself, and it brought me imperceptibly into
contact with God. I was delighted by his assumption of the paternal
character. This was the first time in my life I felt any force,
or perceived any intelligible meaning, in the petition in the Lord's
Prayer&mdash;<em>Our Father, who art in heaven</em>; but yet my perceptions of
its meaning were very vague and indefinite. They did not excite
any emotions of love, or of gratitude, or filial trust; but they left
a strong impression on my mind. It was a strange and startling
impression, that, though an inhabitant of earth, I was moving towards
another world. I am sure I had not thought so much about
God or another world all my life, as I thought that night, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
particularly when my head was on my pillow. My day-thoughts
came up in my dreams, and in a more lucid form, and produced a
more powerful effect. When I awoke in the morning, I felt a
strange sensation of mental ease, which greatly astonished me, as
I knew not by what cause it had been produced. The agitating
forces of bitter grief and sullen discontent were in a state of quietude;
and though not really happy, yet my spirits were buoyant, rising
at times to cheerfulness."</p>

<p>At this juncture she had to fulfil a long-standing engagement&mdash;to
accompany a party of friends on a tour to the north; and though
she endeavoured to excuse herself, yet she felt compelled to yield, as
the excursion had been planned principally on her account. When
alluding to this excursion, at my first interview with her, she said:&mdash;"At
an earlier period of my life, I should have been delighted, when
wandering through the Trosachs or sailing on Lochlomond, when
gazing on the wonders of Staffa or surveying the magnificent scene
from the top of Goatfell; but my mental susceptibilities were unstrung,
and I felt no response to the scenes of beauty and grandeur
which I beheld. But never shall I forget the little unobtrusive inn
at Brodick, nor my neat little bed-room there, as I there saw a Bible,
the first I had seen since I left home. I sat me down, and, in addition
to the two psalms that had become favourites with me, I read
Psalm cvii., which greatly excited me, as it revived the fearful emotions
of the preceding day, when, on nearing Arran, we had to
encounter a terrific storm."</p>

<p>On her return home, she resumed her reading of the Scriptures,
and passed from the Psalms to the Prophecies of Isaiah. The bold
imagery of the prophet delighted her, but she could not trace its
application, or its meaning; and, in reference to his sixth chapter,
she was greatly perplexed to decide whether it was a poetical fiction,
or a real description of heaven. "My first course of reading," she
says in her letter, "left an impression on my mind that we have
not, in any of the walks of literature, such a class of men as the
writers of the Bible. These men possess some rare endowments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
they appear to know more about God and another world than any
other writers whose works I have ever read. There is a majestic
simplicity, and sublime grandeur, in all their statements and descriptions
of the unknown world, and its great spirits."</p>

<p>Having no one to guide her in her study of the Scriptures, her
reading was very desultory; she passed from one book to another
in great mental perplexity, and could not discover any obvious connection
between them, resembling the continuity preserved in other
works with which she was familiar. At length she turned to Paul's
Epistles, but they were dark and mystical, and rather repulsive to
her taste, being so unlike the poetic and the prophetic books; to her
mind they presented no sublimity or beauty; and yet she admitted,
it was a strange repulsiveness&mdash;it gave her no offence, or even distaste
to the Bible. "I now," she adds, "began reading the Gospels.
They were more intelligible. The narratives pleased me. I was
delighted with some of the scenes, particularly the Prodigal Son,
and the Pharisee and Publican in the Temple. The tales interested
me; they seemed to wear the air of truthfulness, and yet at times I
thought them inventions. The history of Jesus Christ very soon
took a strong hold of my imagination, and I soon began to admire
the fine blending of majesty and meekness, of dignity and tenderness,
of lofty bearing, which no insults could disturb, and sweet compassion,
which his character so broadly exhibits. Yes, I often said,
he is a real person, for no human genius could invent such a person,
or draw such a character. I followed him through the dark period
of his agonizing sufferings, from his prostration in the garden to
Calvary, where he was crucified. I wept when I saw him on the
cross."</p>

<p>In one of the interviews I had with her, she said, that two things
both surprised and perplexed her. She was at a loss to conceive the
reason why his countrymen treated Jesus Christ with so much unkindness
and cruelty, when he was such an extraordinary benefactor,
and so benevolent&mdash;going about doing them good, healing their
sick, restoring their injured senses of sight and hearing, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
raising their dead. The other thing that surprised and perplexed
her was, that he should continue to live amongst them, when they
were so rude in their manners, and insolent in their speech, and
when he knew they were often plotting to take away his life. Why
did he not leave them, and go and live amongst some more humane
and generous people, who would return such a style of treatment
by courtesy and gratitude? The more she thought of these things,
the more she was perplexed. She felt so bewildered, that she put
her Bible in her book-case, under an impression she should never
be able to understand it. And yet she could not let it remain there
long. Her curiosity was too much excited, and her self-imposed
prohibition tended to increase her eager solicitude to make out the
meaning of what she read. Hence she resumed her reading exercise;
and on going through the Gospel of John very carefully, a
ray of light fell on <em>one fact</em> in the history of Jesus Christ, which,
while it increased her perplexity, opened the way towards a discovery
to be made in some future stages of her inquiry. The fact
was this: she perceived that, when in conversation with his disciples,
he occasionally made emphatic allusions to the <em>necessity</em> of his death.
This she thought very strange, as it was a case without a parallel
within the compass of her reading. However, it fixed her attention;
and, on a more minute examination, she perceived that he professed
to come from heaven, and avowed his intention of returning thither;
and that he spoke of dying, as though he had a stronger interest in
death than in life, foretelling to his disciples the agonizing death he
was to die (Matt. xx. 17-19). His not recoiling from such a death,
and doing everything in his power to escape it, led her to think
that he was some incarnate being of a peculiar order, who had some
special mission to fulfil, and yet she could not imagine what that
mission could be&mdash;a mission, depending for its accomplishment on
death, rather than on life, appeared to her a mystery too profound
for human ingenuity to unravel. "At length," and I cannot do
better than quote from her letter, she says, "a thought struck me
and I acted on it, and the labour of doing so produced a momentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
suspension of my oppressive anxiety. I arranged, as well as I could,
some of the passages which appeared to assign the reasons for
Christ's death, to which he often alluded, particularly the following:&mdash;'Even
as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many' (Matt. xx. 28). 'I
am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the
sheep.' 'As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father:
and I lay down my life for the sheep.' 'Therefore doth my Father
love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.'
'No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This
commandment have I received of my Father' (John x. 11, 15, 17,
18). I endeavoured to work out an intelligible meaning from
these passages, but I could not. A mysticism enveloped them
which I could not penetrate. I wanted a living expositor. I longed
for an interview with you, and more than once half-resolved to come
and see you, as, though you were a stranger, I felt you were a friend,
and I knew no other whom I could consult. I had no book in my
library which gave me any help, and I knew not what book to inquire
for, if I applied to my bookseller. No language can depict the
excited state of my heart. I felt intuitively assured there was some
latent meaning in these mysterious sayings of Jesus Christ, or he
would not have uttered them. He was too wise and too good to
utter what was false or foolish. But I could not trace out the clue
of discovery. This at times repulsed me, but, on cool reflection, it
appeared like a silent proof that the Bible was not a book of human
invention, as, in that case, I thought, by dint of application, I
should be able to decipher its meaning. One thing now surprises
me, and that is, that, while cherishing the idea that the Bible was
a Divine book, rather than a human one, I never thought of lifting
up my heart in prayer to God for wisdom and grace to understand
it."</p>

<p>In this state of painful bewilderment, depressed by repeated failures
in her efforts to acquire the knowledge which she deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
essential to her happiness, yet resolutely determined to prosecute
her inquiries, she wrote to her uncle, a clergyman of the Church
of England, stating her case, with its painful perplexities, and
desiring his sympathy and advice. He replied, expressing some
surprise at the receipt of such a letter, and intimating his apprehension
that she had been hearing some methodistical or evangelical
preaching, which he denounced as a fatal heresy, more calculated to
drive people into a state of derangement, than to advance them in
virtue or in happiness. He assured her that, as she had been, in
baptism, made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor
of the kingdom of heaven, she need not cherish any anxieties about
her spiritual safety or final salvation. He advised her to banish
the absurd chimÃ¦ras, which were disquieting her, and go and
take the sacrament, which, he said, was the spiritual nourishment
which Almighty God had provided to sustain the inner life of the
soul; and, in addition, he recommended her to mingle rather more
in the circles of gaiety, so as to drive away her melancholy ideas.
This letter was both mystical and unsatisfactory. It contradicted
her experience, and she felt astonished that a clergyman should
advise her to go more frequently into the gay world. "I knew,"
she said, "that my own ideas were not fanciful, but the vague conceptions
of some great truths of the Bible; and I felt as unable to
banish them from my heart, as a person, when asleep, feels unable
to banish the dreams which disquiet him." However, she decided on
joining in the communion; and being then at Bath, away from all
her gay friends, she went to church, and took the sacrament&mdash;a
thing she had never done before. But it had no tranquillizing effect;
indeed, it increased her perplexity, and for awhile made her think
that her case was a hopeless one, and that it would be better for
her to abandon all further solicitude and inquiries, than to cherish
and prosecute them. But she could not bring herself to such a
decision; and the more she laboured to do so, the more anxious
she became to get the clue of discovery, which she thought was to
be found <em>somewhere</em>. In this state of intense anxiety and great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
depression, she returned to her town residence. Her friends were
more assiduous to please than ever; but some were mortified, and
others were offended, because she would not again enter into the gay
scenes and habits of former times; occasionally they hinted their
apprehensions that she would soon turn an Evangelical, and become
as scrupulous and devout as any of the sect. These sarcasms, in
conjunction with her uncle's letter, suggested to her the idea of going
to some church, where an evangelical minister did duty, thinking it
possible that he might give her the explanation she so much desired;
but she long hesitated about doing this, as she had not gone
to any place of public worship for many years, with the exception
of the time when she took the sacrament at Bath. Her desire at
length became so strong, that one Sunday morning she left home,
not knowing where to go; but, on passing along the street, she saw
some respectable and sedate-looking people going into a church,
whither she followed them. This church was a Dissenting chapel,
which, she said, she should not have entered if she had known it, as
she had been accustomed to hear Dissenters spoken of as an uneducated
and uncouth people. She felt a strange sensation on seeing
the clergyman ascend the pulpit in a plain black coat, instead of
going into the reading-desk in a white surplice; but the soft melody
of the singing, and the emphatic solemnity of his style of reading
the Scriptures, calmed her momentary agitation, and she listened
to his prayer with devout seriousness. This was the first extempore
prayer she had ever heard; and when speaking of it, in one
of our interviews, she remarked that, in one particular, it bore a
resemblance to her Bible reading&mdash;parts were plain and intelligible,
and parts were under a veil of mysteriousness. The minister seemed
to know the desires and emotions that were stirring within her,
and he expressed them with so much accuracy and force, that it
greatly astonished her. "Had I confessed to him," she remarked,
"he could not have had a more perfect knowledge of what was
passing in my mind."</p>

<p>When God has any special design to accomplish, we may often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
trace the harmonious conjunction of the various agents and agencies
which he employs in effecting it. The Ethiopian eunuch was sitting
in his chariot, reading the prophet Esaias, when Philip, under a
Divine impulse, went and seated himself by his side. The passage
he was reading was veiled in darkness, and he asked for an explanation,
which was immediately given, understood, and felt; the moral
transformation took place by the concurring action of Divine power;
he avowed his newly originated faith; was baptized, and went on
his way rejoicing&mdash;the visible agent of the great transaction disappearing,
that the tribute of adoring gratitude might be offered up
exclusively to the God of all grace. We pass from this wondrous
scene to another, stamped with the same moral insignia, though not
quite so obviously conspicuous. Here is a person of superior intelligence,
who has long been labouring, by her own unaided reason,
to decipher the hidden mysteries of the truth as it is in Jesus, and
labouring in vain. She leaves her own home on a Sabbath morning
in quest of a living expositor, yet not knowing where to find
one. An unseen hand guides her to a chapel, which she would
have disdained to enter had she known its denominational character.
Her latent prejudices spring up into powerful action when she observes
a slight deviation in the order of the service from that with
which her eye was once familiar; and yet they are overcome by a
devotional exercise, which surprised her by its novelty, while it
strongly interested her by its appropriateness. The question she
left home to have solved is a simple, yet a very important one; and
on its solution her happiness is dependent. The second hymn is
sung. The minister rises in his pulpit; his Bible is open before
him, and, after a short pause, he announces his text, "And I, if I
be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This he
said, signifying what death he should die" (John xii. 32, 33). The
sketch he gives of the crucifixion is thrilling; and many weep while
he presents to their view the chief actors who performed their parts
on this tragical occasion. Mrs. Hastings also weeps. The preacher
now passes from description to explanation; from a detailed statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of facts, to an elucidation of the design for which the Son of
God groaned, and bled, and died. She listens with breathless attention,
as he unravels the thread of mystery which ran through
all the passages of the Bible which she had arranged and studied,
without perceiving their import. "I felt," she said, "intuitively
assured, when he entered on this part of his subject, that the light
of explanation was coming; and I was intensely eager to catch every
utterance. I now perceived that the death of Jesus Christ was a
voluntary ransom, to redeem and to save the lost and the guilty.
The first part of his sermon awakened my sympathy; the latter
part touched another chord of my heart. I wept again; but from a
different cause. My sins made me weep; and the love of Christ in
dying to expiate them, made me weep&mdash;and I now wept as I had
never wept before. It was with some difficulty I could refrain weeping,
even when the clergyman had finished his sermon, which lasted
rather more than an hour. I could have listened to him much
longer. I never knew time go so rapidly. I left the hallowed
place with reluctance, thinking, as I paced back to my home, that I
was now entering as into a new world of existence, abounding with
mystic, yet intelligible wonders. I was in a tumult of emotion, yet it
was a calm ecstasy of feeling. I clasped my Bible, and pressed it to
my bosom. I thought of your words, which I never forgot, though,
when I first heard them, they sounded in my ear as the mockery of
grief:&mdash;'That book has healed wounds as deep as yours; and if you
examine it, you will find it a well-spring of life to your withered
happiness.' I now can attest the truth of your declaration. I have
tasted its sweet waters; they are indeed the waters of life. None
other so sweet or powerful. I can now respond to the truthfulness
of the following paraphrase of Dr. Watts, whom I now prefer to
Byron or Wordsworth&mdash;he is the poet of the heart weighed down
by sorrow and anxiety:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>I was happy to find that she had withdrawn from the gay circles
of fashion, and, while she kept up a partial intimacy with some of
her former associates, her spirit and example bore a testimony
against their vain and ensnaring pursuits. She had put on a religious
profession, and felt it to be an honour to obtain membership
with the church of which her spiritual counsellor and guide was
the pastor. This gave great offence to her clerical uncle, and also
to some of her other relatives who resided in London, but she was
too independent in spirit to submit to the arbitrary control of those
who were the secret enemies of the cross of Christ; and though she
did not court reproach as a desirable test of principle, yet she gave
proof, by her steadfastness in the faith, and the amiable placidity
of her temper, that it possessed no power to warp her judgment or
disturb her peace. She was too retiring in her habits to take an
active part in any of the public institutions connected with the
church and congregation of which she was a member, but she became
a generous contributor to their funds, doing good and working
righteousness, not desiring to be seen of men&mdash;a devout woman,
who feared God above many. She might again and again have
changed her widowed state, and with flattering prospect of distinction
and happiness, but she had fully made up her mind, that
she would never put off the weeds of widowhood till the set time
came when she was to pass away from earth, to be arrayed in the
vestments of the heavenly world. She cherished through every
stage of life the memory of her dear departed husband with an
intensity of feeling which appeared to increase as she advanced in
years. To the poor of the household of faith she was a warm-hearted
and liberal benefactor; in no exercise did she take more
delight than in visiting the sick and afflicted; and though a Dissenter,
she was free from bigotry and prejudice, and could say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with the apostle, "Grace be with all them that love our Lord
Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen" (Eph. vi. 24).</p>

<p>Our correspondence was kept up for a number of years, and in one
of her last letters she says:&mdash;"I am truly thankful to God that he
gave me grace to withdraw from the gay world. It is altogether a
gorgeous sham&mdash;a fascinating delusion; felt as such even by those
who are spell-bound by its charms. I often look back, dear Sir, with
astonishment and gratitude, to our casual meeting in the stage coach,
which has proved to me the most eventful and the most important
occurrence of my life. It has been the introduction of a new era in
my history. The mystery of my irreparable loss is now explained.
The husband of my devoted attachment was smitten, and died. He
was taken from me without my being permitted to say farewell, and,
even to this hour, I feel a bitter pang when I think of his melancholy
end. Had he been spared to feel what I have felt of spiritual
sorrow, and of spiritual consolation and hope, we should have lived
in the sweet anticipations of eternal life. I pine, but I dare not
murmur. The past is the fearful thunder-storm of desolation, from
which, praise be to God, I have now emerged, and enjoy the brightness
and calm of a serene and unclouded sky.</p>

<p>"When, my dear Sir, I contrast, as I often do, my present, with
my former self&mdash;my present, with my former tastes&mdash;my present,
with my former habits, and my present bright prospects of immortality
with my former prospects, overshadowed by the deep gloom
of ceaseless sorrow&mdash;I appear a wonder to myself. I am the same
person I was when I repelled your advice to read the Bible, thinking
it a piece of wild fanaticism; but how changed am I now in
heart and feeling&mdash;become, I trust, a new creature in Christ Jesus."
Psalm ciii. 1-5.</p>

<p>My friend who announced to me the decease of Mrs. Hastings,
informed me that her preceding illness was not of long duration,
nor was it attended by any severe physical sufferings. During its
continuance, her mind was kept in perfect peace; and at times, she
felt a joy unspeakable in anticipation of beholding the Son of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
who was crucified on Calvary, seated on his celestial throne; and of
mingling with the countless myriads, in offering their adorations
and praises. Her last intelligible utterance was, "Lord Jesus, receive
my spirit;" and, after a slight convulsive struggle, she cast
one look on the friend standing by her side, and then expired.</p>

<h2>THE FAMILY OF THE HOLMES.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="O" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">On my return one afternoon from a round of pastoral
visits, I was informed that a gentleman was waiting
to see me; and I received a most agreeable surprise
in finding that it was no other than Mr. Holmes, an
old and much valued friend, and whose eldest daughter Louisa
has already been casually mentioned as a friend and correspondent
of Miss Roscoe.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He informed me that he had just left his family
at Dawlish, their favourite summer resort, where they had
been rusticating for nearly two months, and had come to transact
some business in my neighbourhood. I pressed him to remain
a few days with me, but he would consent to stay only one night,
as he had already been occupied a longer time than he expected.
Before leaving, he extorted a promise from me that, as soon as my
avocations permitted it, I would pay him a visit at the Elms, his
seat near London, whither he and his family expected to return in
the end of the summer.</p>
</div>

<p>The history of Mr. Holmes' career in life is an interesting one,
and furnishes a striking example of those gradual elevations from
poverty and obscurity to affluence and an honoured position in the
world, which are, perhaps, more frequently to be met with in the
ranks of English society than in those of any other country. I will
here give some account of it, as exhibiting an instructive example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of persevering industry and upright conduct, crowned by honour
and success.</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes was the second son of a respectable farmer, who rented
a small estate in the county of Warwick. When a little boy he was
very inquisitive, fond of mixing with his seniors and superiors, from
whom he gained much information; and though there was no good
school in the neighbourhood, yet, by the assistance of the kind and
amiable Vicar of the parish, he acquired the rudiments of a useful
education. That leisure time which other children usually devote
to play, he gave to reading and study, and before he was fourteen,
he was a very good accountant. He happened, when about nine
years old, to read the popular story of <em>Whittington and his Cat</em>, and
such was the deep impression it made on his mind, that it became
the perpetual subject of his conversation; and he would often amuse
the other members of the family with visionary tales of his future
eminence. He would say to his brothers, "I will leave <em>you</em> to feed
cows, and pigs, and horses, and turn up the clods of the field; but
when I grow up, I will go to London, and see if I cannot become as
great a man as Whittington." So completely had this passion gained
an ascendency over him, that he would often walk miles to see the
mail coach pass along the road towards the far-famed city; and
after listening to the sound of the horn, with an ecstasy of delight
which no other notes could inspire, he would return home to talk
and to dream of his future adventures.</p>

<p>When about the age of fifteen, his father died, leaving a large
family unprovided for; and as Henry could not think of remaining
any longer at home, his mother gave him a guinea and a few shillings,
and he set off to seek his fortune. His youthful ardour kindled
into rapture when he first saw the distant dome of St. Paul's towering
above the buildings and smoke of the wondrous metropolis.
Though he occasionally shed a tear of affection at the remembrance
of his beloved relatives in his native village, yet he was so absorbed
in the visions of his own fancy, that he was rarely depressed. Several
days were spent in fruitless efforts to obtain a situation&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
few shillings were expended, and the shadows of another night were
deepening into darkness, when he sat down on the stone steps in
front of a gentleman's house to rest himself. While he sat there
ruminating over the scenes of his boyhood, and pleasing himself
with the hopes of brighter and better days, a gentleman in a gig
drove up to the door; and as he was getting out, Henry rose and
offered his assistance by holding the horse. The quickness of his
movements, and the pleasing smile on his fine ruddy countenance,
attracted the notice of Mr. Lucas, who asked him his name and place
of residence. "My name, Sir, is Henry Holmes," he replied; "I
was born in the county of Warwick; my father was a farmer, and
he is just dead. I did not like to stay at home to be a burden to my
mother, who has a large family to bring up, so I left home last
Monday, to see if I could get a place of work in London; and if
you will hire me, Sir, I will try to please you." This simple, artless
tale made its way to the heart of Mr. Lucas, who said, "How
long have you been in London?" "Three days, Sir, but I have not
been able to get any work." "Have you any money?" "Yes, Sir,
I have a guinea which mother gave me when I left home, but I am
afraid to change it, for if I do, all my money may soon be gone."
This circumstance gave Mr. Lucas such a high opinion of Henry's
carefulness of disposition, that he at once resolved to take him into
his service. Having obtained his mother's address, he wrote to her
and also to the Vicar of the parish. In a few days he received an
answer which confirmed the truth of the statement of the adventurous
youth, and at the same time bore honourable testimony to
his fidelity and industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas was a grocer, who lived in Fore Street, and had acquired
a handsome fortune by his trade. Like most wealthy citizens,
he had his country-house, where he resided during the summer
months, coming to business in the morning and returning in the
evening. As his groom had just left him, the thought struck him
that this country lad might very well supply his place; and Henry
rejoiced to enter on his new employment. He had to clean the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and gig, the knives and shoes, and look after some choice poultry;
and such was the attention he paid to his work, and the amiability
of his disposition, that he soon became a favourite with the whole
family. On their return to town for the winter he accompanied
them; and as he possessed talents which fitted him for a higher
situation, his master took him into the shop, where he distinguished
himself by his close attention to business. No one was cleaner in
his person, or neater in his dress; no one was more obliging in his
disposition; the rusticity of his appearance soon wore off; his punctuality
and habit of despatch became proverbial; and though his
temper was hasty and irritable, yet he kept it in a state of subjection,
and uniformly displayed a union of excellencies, which is but
rarely found in so young a person.</p>

<p>Such is the precarious tenure on which men hold their reputation
under the mysterious dispensations of Providence, that it is often
endangered no less by their virtues than their vices; and those who
at one period are esteemed and admired by the wise and the good,
are at another plunged into the depth of misery by the malignant
cruelty of the wicked. Thus it was with Henry. There were two persons
belonging to the establishment, his seniors in age, and superiors
in rank, who were jealous of him; and as they could not shake the
stability of his character by any just accusations, they resolved to
destroy it by artifice. One of them who had the care of the till-drawer
complained for several succeeding evenings of having missed
some money, and it was arranged that some marked money should
be put into the drawer. This was done; at nine o'clock the money
was counted, and the sum of five shillings and sixpence was missing.
This fact was immediately communicated to Mr. Lucas, who called
all the servants into the counting-house, and proposed that each one
should have his person and his boxes searched, without being permitted
to leave the room. To this proposal they all assented; and
lots were drawn to determine the exact order in which the search
should be made. The first name drawn was the head-shopman, who
immediately gave up all his keys to Mr. Lucas, and underwent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
strictest examination, but he was pronounced innocent; the second
was the man who had the care of the till, and he also was pronounced
innocent; the third was Henry Holmes, who, after being searched,
said, "My box, Sir, is not locked." Mr. Lucas then quitted the
room to search it, and on his return, looking steadfastly in Henry's
face, said, "I certainly did not suspect you, Henry, but I have found
the money in your box" (producing it), "and as you have given me
such a proof of your ingratitude and perfidy, you shall leave my
house to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Henry in a firm tone, "I am innocent. Some one
has placed the money in my box which might be very easily done,
as I scarcely ever lock it."</p>

<p>"I have suspected you for a long time," said one of the shopmen;
"for no one is so likely to be guilty of fraud, as he who overacts the
part of virtue."</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas now withdrew into the parlour, when he related the
whole circumstances, and as soon as Mrs. Lucas heard the accusation
of the shopman, she said, "Henry is innocent. He is the victim of
another's treachery, and some plan must be adopted to detect the
culprit. In my opinion the accuser is the guilty party, or at least
an accomplice. It is fair to presume that he who stole the last
sum, stole the preceding sums that have been lost. How then will
you account for finding only the five shillings and sixpence?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible," said Miss Lucas, "that Henry can be the thief.
We never lost anything when he was with us in the country, and
we know that he does not go out to places of amusement like the
others, and therefore he is under less temptation to extravagance
than they are. There is a plot to effect his ruin, which I hope
and trust will be discovered."</p>

<p>While they were talking, the housemaid entered the parlour, and
said, that she had just overheard the two young men talking together
on the subject, and she distinctly heard one say, "It was
well planned, and well executed, and now we shall get rid of him."
She was requested to take no notice of what she had heard, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to act as though she really believed that Henry was guilty. As these
two young men slept together, Mr. Lucas removed some tea chests
which stood against a thin partition that separated their bedroom
from an upper warehouse, and having placed himself near an aperture
in one of the boards, he waited till they retired to rest.
Having, from their conversation, received a full conviction of their
guilt, he withdrew, and informed his wife and daughter that he was
perfectly satisfied of Henry's innocence.</p>

<p>The next morning he rose rather earlier than usual, and before
the porter had opened the shop, he summoned all the shopmen into
his presence, and charged these two men, first, with the crime of
stealing the money, and then with the still baser crime of attempting
to involve an innocent person in their guilt. This unexpected
charge&mdash;the indignant firmness with which it was brought&mdash;the involuntary
movement of Henry, who came forward to look his accusers
in the face, confounded and abashed them; and though each
made some faint efforts to deny it, yet when Mr. Lucas repeated
the conversation which he had overheard the preceding night, and
threatened that if they did not immediately acknowledge their
guilt, and solicit Henry's forgiveness, he would send for the police,
they made a full confession, and implored mercy in the most suppliant
manner. Henry at once forgave them, and interceded for them;
but Mr. Lucas would not consent that such men should remain in
his service, and having paid them their arrears of wages, he discharged
them.</p>

<p>This plot, which was laid to effect Henry's ruin, led to his advancement,
and he now rose rapidly, step after step, till he became
the manager of Mr. Lucas' establishment.</p>

<p>We often see tradesmen, when they have amassed a large fortune,
affecting contempt for the rank of life in which they have moved,
discovering at the same time a strong anxiety that their children,
especially their daughters, should form alliances with those who
move in the higher and more exalted circles of society. Hence they
will often sacrifice a daughter at the shrine of their vanity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
give a large portion of the wealth which their industry has accumulated,
to some titled pauper, whose extravagance first reduces
her to beggary, and whose unkindness at length breaks her heart.
But Mr. Lucas was a wise man. He never rose in feeling or in expectation
above the level of his station. He had but one child, and
he wished to see her happy; and when he perceived that a mutual
regard subsisted between her and Henry, he expressed his entire
approbation, and they were married. On this event taking place,
Mr. Lucas retired from business, and at his decease, which happened
about twelve months after that of his wife, he left the greater part
of his property to Mr. Holmes.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Holmes, who had thus risen, by the Divine blessing on his
industry, from a humble situation to a position of wealth and eminence,
would often allude in conversation to his original condition,
and exhibit his guinea as a proud memorial of his former poverty;&mdash;thus
rebuking, by his example, the pride of many a modern Cr&oelig;sus,
who is no less anxious to conceal from others his origin, than to
make an ostentatious display of his wealth. He had a large family,
and as he took considerable pains with the education of his children,
and set before them an example worthy of their imitation, he had the
pleasure of seeing them growing up, esteemed and respected, bidding
fair to be the ornaments of a future generation. His two eldest
sons were in partnership with him, his youngest was studying medicine,
one daughter was married to a country gentleman in Warwickshire,
and three were still living with him. He had long resisted
the importunity of his children to take some country residence, that
they might enjoy an occasional retreat from the noise, and smoke,
and bustle of the city; but when his wife urged the measure, it was
at once adopted, as he was no less anxious to gratify her wishes than
she was to avoid the indulgence of unsuitable gratifications.</p>

<p>After many unsuccessful efforts to obtain an eligible residence, he
purchased a small estate about seven miles from London, where he
erected a neat and commodious mansion; and as his two sons were
now able to manage his business, he retired from the more active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and laborious duties of it, to spend the evening of his days amidst
rural scenes, with which his earliest and deepest impressions were
associated. Having been accustomed, when a child, to attend his
parish church on the Sabbath, he regularly observed the practice
through life; and though for many years he had no clear perceptions
of the nature or the design of the gospel, yet soon after the
settlement of the Rev. Mr. Newton at St. Mary Woolnoth, he began
to feel its enlightening and purifying influence. At first he disliked
his style of preaching, and the pride of his heart rose up against that
plan of salvation which requires the man of virtue to implore mercy
in terms as humiliating as those which the chief of sinners employ;
but as his knowledge increased, his prejudices gradually subsided,
and though he could not remember any specific time when the great
moral change was effected, by which he passed from death unto life,
yet he uniformly spoke of it as the most important and blissful event
of his history.</p>

<p>The renovation which the grace of God produces in the human
character, often leaves the ruling passion to retain its ascendency,
while it gives it a new direction; and he who undergoes it, usually
displays the same bold decision or hesitating precaution&mdash;the same
spirit of active enterprise or prudent consideration, in his religious
profession, that he has been accustomed to display in the avocations
of everyday life. But on some occasions it is just the reverse; and
we see the avowed infidel, when convinced of the truth of the gospel,
halting between two opinions&mdash;the active tradesman, who keeps
the machinery of a large and complicated concern in a brisk and
constant motion, a lukewarm Christian&mdash;and the man who could
face, without flinching, the most appalling dangers, discover a shrinking
timidity when the obligations to a life of practical devotedness
to God are pressed upon his attention. To account for such a moral
phenomenon would be absolutely impossible, unless we advert to
the powerful influence which sensible objects are known to possess
over the mind, especially during that period in the religious experience
of a Christian when his faith in the Divine testimony is weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and defective; but as that great moral principle increases in strength
and animation, the natural dispositions recover their native tone and
vigour&mdash;the mind no more vacillates&mdash;but rising to a full conviction
of the superior value of the things which are unseen and eternal,
gives to them its supreme attention and affection.</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes felt the transforming power of the truth soon after
his marriage, which led him to the adoption of religious habits and
customs; but he was too deeply involved in the cares and perplexities
of business to become a very zealous and public-spirited Christian.
His moral character was unimpeachable, and he brought the
great principles of religion to regulate his conduct in the ordinary
affairs of life; but his heart was too much in the world&mdash;the fervour
of his devotional spirit bore no just proportion to his diligence in
business, and he was less anxious for the higher attainments of
faith than for the acquisition of wealth. He regularly attended the
ministry of the Rev. Mr. Newton on the Sabbath; but that ministry
was more frequently the word of reproof than consolation; and
though the hope of a blissful immortality would sometimes dawn
upon him, yet it shone with too feeble a ray to afford him entire
satisfaction; as it is wisely ordained that a full assurance of eternal
life shall be imparted only to those who give <em>diligence</em> to make their
calling and election sure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes was certainly more devout than her husband, and
devoted a larger proportion of her time to reading and meditation;
but her associations were unfavourable to the growth of her piety,
which, though sincere, was too much tinctured with superstition.
She thought more of her duties than her privileges&mdash;of her defects
than of Him who came to repair them&mdash;placed more dependence for
consolation and hope on prayer and watchfulness than on the blood
of sprinkling; and, while she did not doubt the truth of the promises,
she uniformly gave a more implicit assent to the threatenings
of the sacred volume. She was rather a disciple of the mortified
Baptist than of the merciful Redeemer. Her devotions were sincere
and fervent, but not elevating. They consisted much in contrition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
but little in praise&mdash;much in sorrow for sin, but little in
hope of its pardon. She did not sufficiently cast her confidence on
the great Propitiation. She firmly believed all that the Saviour had
done and suffered for sinners, but she could not claim for her own
enjoyment the benefits resulting from his mission and death. While
she was painfully working out her salvation with fear and trembling,
she indulged the most unfounded apprehensions of the Divine
displeasure, and lived more in dread of perishing than in expectation
of being saved.</p>

<p>No circumstance gave them so much uneasiness, on their removal
to their country seat, as the loss of that ministry under which they
had been brought to feel the power of the truth; especially as the
Vicar of the parish was decidedly opposed to evangelical sentiments.
The junior branches of the family were intelligent and accomplished,
but they made no profession of religion; and now they
were liberated from the restraints which a faithful and an enlightened
ministry had thrown over the evil tendencies of their nature,
they evinced a strong inclination to adopt the habits, and conform
to the customs of fashionable life, which greatly perplexed and
depressed their pious parents, especially their mother. An intimate
friend (Mrs. Loader), who spent some weeks at the Elms, saw
this manifest change in their predilections, and availing herself of
a favourable opportunity, she alluded to it, when in conversation
with Miss Holmes, and delicately, yet most earnestly, urged her to
be on her guard, or the change in their place of residence would
become a snare, if it did not break up all their religious habits, and
prove fatal to their spiritual happiness and safety. This admonitory
warning Louisa received with gratitude, as a fresh proof of the kind
concern her friend felt for the best interests, both of herself and of
the entire family. "Indeed," she remarked, "the world abounds
with evil, but no temptation is so pernicious, or so much to be dreaded,
as irreligious society; and this is the only society which we now
have. I fear it will prove destructive of all the good impressions
we have received under the ministry of the venerable Mr. Newton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
His appeals operated as a check and as a restraint on the evil
tendencies of our nature; but now we are allured into worldly habits,
by being told from the pulpit that we ought to see life, and
have free access to all its scenes and sources of pleasure and amusement.
Mamma has been endeavouring to persuade papa to take
an excursion to Dawlish, which will remove us from this scene of
danger, and I hope on our return we shall be enabled to withstand
every enticement injurious to our religious habits." On taking
leave, Mrs. Loader presented her with a copy of Doddridge's <cite>Rise
and Progress of Religion in the Soul</cite>, which Miss Holmes said she
had read, but promised to peruse again, as a compliment to the
kindness which had dictated the present.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes' two sisters, Emma and Jane, were several years
younger than herself. They bore some resemblance to each other
in the general outlines of their character, but materially differed in
some of its more prominent features. As they had just finished
their education in a school, where all the accomplishments could be
acquired, except the one most essential to human happiness, they felt
themselves in their native element when moving in the circles of
gaiety and folly. Emma had the finest figure, but Jane possessed
the most cultivated mind. The former excelled in gracefulness of
manners, the latter in sweetness of disposition; and while Emma
was rather fond of display, there was an unobtrusive modesty about
Jane which inclined her to conceal her most attractive charms.
Emma appeared to most advantage in a large party, where she
moved, and spoke as though she were the presiding spirit of the
scene; Jane, in a select circle, where the interchange of thought and
sentiment could take place without being subjected to the interruptions
and breaks which a promiscuous throng invariably occasions.
Emma was rather of a satirical temper, with a keen sense of
the ludicrous; but Jane surpassed most of her own age in that practical
good sense which is more valuable than artificial polish. Though,
however, they thus differed so materially in some of the more prominent
features of their character, they were nevertheless passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fond of each other, and much attached to their parents, their
brothers, and sisters.</p>

<p>As Mr. Holmes had applied himself to the toils of business with
unremitting constancy for so many years, and had acquired a large
fortune, he yielded without hesitation to the solicitations of Mrs.
Holmes and his daughters, and took a tour with them through the
west of England, visiting in their route all the localities either
famed for their natural beauty, or interesting by their historical
associations. Travelling by easy stages, they at last reached Dawlish
in Devonshire, with which they were so much delighted that
they remained there for several months. Here it was that Miss
Holmes was introduced to Miss Roscoe, with whom she formed an
acquaintance, which soon ripened to an ardent friendship, and proved
in future years a source of much spiritual enjoyment.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A MISFORTUNE OFTEN A BLESSING IN
DISGUISE.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_149.jpg" alt="S" width="100" height="105" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Shortly after the return of the family to the Elms,
from their Devonshire excursion, Miss Holmes sustained
an accident, which, though apparently an untoward
occurrence, she used afterwards to speak of as
having exercised a most salutary influence on her character. As
she was stepping out of the carriage one day, the horses suddenly
moved forwards, by which her foot got entangled between the step
and the wheel, and she was very much injured. A messenger was
immediately despatched for a surgeon, who, on examining the
bruised parts, reported that no bones were broken, but said that
the ancle joint had been violently sprained. After the application
of leeches, and giving orders to prepare a fomentation to reduce
the swelling, he requested that she would immediately retire to rest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and if she felt any pain in the morning, not to attempt to walk, but
keep her foot in a horizontal position. These instructions were attended
to; but she passed a very restless night, and in the morning
was much worse than had been expected. This accident confined
her a close prisoner for some months, so that she had no opportunity
of renewing her former intimacies, which had been interrupted
by the excursion to the west of England. Many called and
left their cards, and some of her more intimate friends would come
occasionally and sit with her; but a sick chamber possesses few attractions
for the votaries of pleasure, who generally turn from it
with careless indifference.</p>
</div>

<p>As she usually enjoyed a great flow of spirits, and was rather
volatile in her disposition&mdash;more fond of the pleasures of society
than the grave exercises of meditation&mdash;she was very depressed and
irritable during the first few weeks of her confinement, often censuring
in strong terms the inattention of the servant in leaving the
horses; but she gradually became more reconciled to her state, and
at length turned her attention to reading, to divert her mind
and beguile the tedious hours. She would have preferred some of
the popular tales and novels of the day to any of the volumes in
her father's library; but she had too much regard for his authority
and his feelings to send for works which she knew would be
displeasing to him.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when her parents and sisters went to dine with her
brothers in London, leaving her alone, she requested the servant to
bring her a book; and one book after another was brought, and closed
almost as soon as she had read the title-page. At length she thought
of the book which her esteemed friend, Mrs. Loader, had given her,
and of her promise to peruse it. She took it up from the table near
which she was sitting, but after turning over a few leaves put it
from her, saying, "I have read it." But as she had pledged herself
to read it again, she took the book once more&mdash;reluctantly and carelessly
read the running titles which are prefixed to its different
chapters, till she came to the tenth, when her attention was imperceptibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
arrested, and she perused it with a degree of interest which
no other religious composition had ever excited.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>"Thus far have I often known convictions and impressions to
arise, which, after all, have worn off again. Some unhappy circumstance
of external temptation, ever joined by the inward reluctance
of an unsanctified heart to the scheme of redemption, has been the
ruin of multitudes. And, 'through the deceitfulness of sin, they
have been hardened,' till they seem to have been 'utterly destroyed,
and that without remedy.' And therefore, O thou immortal creature,
who art now reading these lines, I beseech thee, that, while
affairs are in this critical situation, while there are these balancings
of mind between accepting and rejecting that glorious gospel which
I now lay before you, you will give me an attentive audience, while
'I pray you in Christ's stead that you would be reconciled to God.'</p>

<p>"One would indeed imagine there should be no need of importunity
here. One would conclude, that as soon as perishing sinners
are told that an offended God is ready to be reconciled&mdash;that he
offers them a full pardon for all their aggravated sins&mdash;yea, that
he is willing to adopt them into his family now, that he may at
length admit them to his heavenly presence&mdash;all should, with the
utmost readiness and pleasure, embrace so kind a message, and
fall at his feet in speechless transports of astonishment, gratitude,
and joy. But alas! we find it much otherwise. We see multitudes
quite unmoved, and the impressions which are made on
many more are feeble and transient. Lest it should be thus with
you, O reader, let me urge the message with which I have the
honour to be charged; let me entreat you to be reconciled to God,
and to accept of pardon and salvation in the way in which it is
so freely offered to you.</p>

<p>"I entreat you, 'by the majesty of that God in whose name I
come,' whose voice fills all heaven with reverence and obedience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
He speaks not in vain to legions of angels; but if there could be
any contention among those blessed spirits, it would be, who should
be first to execute his commands. Oh, let him not speak in vain
to you! I entreat you, 'by the terrors of his wrath,' who could
speak to you in thunder&mdash;who could, by one single act of his will,
cut off this precarious life of yours, and send you down to hell. I
beseech you by his tender mercies, which still yearn over you, as
those of a parent over 'a dear son,' over a tender child, whom,
notwithstanding his former ungrateful rebellion, 'he earnestly remembers
still.' I entreat you, 'by all this paternal goodness,' that
you do not compel him to lose the character of the gentle Parent in
that of the righteous Judge.</p>

<p>"I beseech you further, 'by the name and love of our dying Saviour.'
I beseech you, by all the condescension of his incarnation,
by that poverty to which he voluntarily submitted, 'that you
might be enriched' with eternal treasures; by all the gracious invitations
which he gave, which still sound in his Word, and still
coming, as it were, warm from his heart, are 'sweeter than honey
or the honey-comb.' I beseech you, by all his glorious works of
power and of wonder, which were also works of love. I beseech
you, by the memory of the most benevolent Person, and the most
generous Friend. I beseech you, by the memory of what he suffered,
as well as of what he said and did; by the agony which he endured
in the garden, when his body was covered 'with a dew of blood.'
I beseech you, by all that tender distress which he felt, when his
dearest friends 'forsook him and fled,' and his blood-thirsty enemies
dragged him away, like the meanest of slaves, and like the
vilest of criminals. I beseech you, by the blows and bruises, by the
stripes and lashes, which this injured Sovereign endured while in
their rebellious hands; 'by the shame of spitting, from which he
hid not that kind and venerable countenance.' I beseech you, 'by
the purple robe, the sceptre of reed, and the crown of thorns which
this King of glory wore, that he might set us among the princes of
heaven.' I beseech you, by the heavy burden of 'the cross,' under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which he panted, and toiled, and fainted in the painful way 'to Golgotha,'
that he might free us from the burden of our sins. I beseech
you, by the remembrance of those rude nails that tore the
veins and arteries, the nerves and tendons, of his sacred hands and
feet; and by that invincible, that triumphant goodness, which,
while the iron pierced his flesh, engaged him to cry out, 'Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do.' I beseech you, by
that unutterable anguish which he bore, when lifted up upon the
cross, and extended there as on a rack for six painful hours, that you
open your heart to those attractive influences which have 'drawn to
him thousands, and ten thousands.' I beseech you by all that insult
and derision which the 'Lord of glory bore there;' by that
parching thirst, which could hardly obtain the relief of 'vinegar;'
by that doleful cry, so astonishing in the mouth of the only-begotten
of the Father, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' I
beseech you, by that grace that subdued and pardoned 'a dying
malefactor;' by that compassion for sinners, by that compassion for
you, which wrought in his heart long as its vital motion continued,
and which ended not when 'he bowed his head, saying, It is finished,
and gave up the ghost.' I beseech you, by the triumphs of that resurrection
by which he was 'declared to be the Son of God with
power;' by the spirit of holiness which wrought to accomplish it; by
that gracious tenderness which attempered all those triumphs, when
he said to her out of whom he had cast seven devils, concerning his
disciples, who had treated him so basely, 'Go, tell my brethren, I
ascend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your
God.' I beseech you, by that condescension with which he said to
Thomas, when his unbelief had made such an unreasonable demand,
'Reach hither thy finger, and behold mine hands, and reach hither
thine hand, and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.'
I beseech you, by that generous and faithful care of his people,
which he carried up with him to the regions of glory, and which
engaged him to send down 'his Spirit,' in the rich profusion of miraculous
gifts, to spread the progress of his saving Word. I beseech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
you, by that voice of sympathy and power, with which he said to
Saul, while injuring his church, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
me?' by that generous goodness, which spared the prostrate enemy
when he lay trembling at his feet, and raised him to so high a dignity
as to be 'not inferior to the very chiefest apostles.' I beseech you,
by the memory of all that Christ hath already done, by the expectation
of all he will further do for his people. I beseech you, at once,
by the sceptre of his grace, and by the sword of his justice, with
which all his incorrigible 'enemies' shall be 'slain before him,' that
you do not trifle away these precious moments, while his Spirit is
thus breathing upon you&mdash;that you do not lose an opportunity
which may never return, and on the improvement of which eternity
depends.</p>

<p>"I beseech you, 'by all the bowels of compassion which you owe
to the faithful ministers of Christ,' who are studying and labouring,
preaching and praying, wearing out their time, exhausting their
strength, and very probably shortening their lives, for the salvation
of your soul, and of souls like yours. I beseech you, by the affection
with which all that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity long to
see you brought back to him. I beseech you, by the friendship of
the living, and by the memory of the dead; by the ruin of those
who have trifled away their days and are perished in their sins, and
the happiness of those who have embraced the gospel and are saved
by it. I beseech you, by the great expectation of that important
'day, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven;' by 'the
terrors of a dissolving world;' by the 'sound of the archangel's
trumpet,' and of that infinitely more awful sentence, 'Come, ye
blessed, and depart, ye cursed,' with which that awful solemnity
shall close.</p>

<p>"I beseech you, finally, by your own precious and immortal soul;
by the sure prospect of a dying bed, or of sudden surprise into the
invisible state, and as you would feel one spark of comfort in your
departing spirit when your flesh and your heart are failing. I beseech
you, by your own personal appearance before the tribunal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Christ (for a personal appearance it must be, even to those who now
sit on thrones of their own); by all the transports of the blessed,
and by all the agonies of the damned, the one or the other of which
must be your everlasting portion. I affectionately entreat and beseech
you, in the strength of all these united considerations, as you
will answer it to me, who may on that day be summoned to testify
against you; and, which is unspeakably more, as you will answer
it to your own conscience&mdash;as you will answer it to the eternal Judge&mdash;that
you dismiss not these thoughts, these meditations, and these
cares, till you have brought matters to a happy issue&mdash;till you have
made a resolute choice of Christ, and his appointed way of salvation;
and till you have solemnly devoted yourself to God in the bonds of
an everlasting covenant.</p>

<p>"And thus I leave the matter before you and before the Lord. I
have told you my errand; I have discharged my embassy. Stronger
arguments I cannot use&mdash;more endearing and more awful considerations
I cannot suggest. Choose, therefore, whether you will go out,
as it were, clothed in sackcloth, to cast yourself at the feet of him
who now sends you these equitable and gracious terms of peace
and pardon; or whether you will hold it out till he appears, sword
in hand, to reckon with you for your treasons and your crimes,
and for this neglected embassy among the rest. Fain would I hope
the best; nor can I believe that this labour of love shall be entirely
unsuccessful&mdash;that not one soul shall be brought to the foot of
Christ in cordial submission and humble faith. 'Take with you,'
therefore, 'words, and turn unto the Lord,' and say unto him,
'Take away all iniquity, and receive me graciously; so will I render
the praise of my lips.'"</p>

<p>The impression which this reading produced was such as she had
never previously felt; the arrow of conviction had pierced her
heart, but the feelings excited were more those of joy than of grief.
She re-perused the chapter; it disclosed new beauties&mdash;it sent forth
a still stronger power of excitement. Her soul was alternately
elevated and depressed, agonized and composed, as though she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
no control over its movements. She recalled to her remembrance
those powerful, yet momentary impressions of truth, which she had
experienced in former years, when sitting under the ministry of the
venerable Newton; and trembled lest those under which she was
now labouring should prove equally transient. It was this fearful
apprehension which gave her more pain, than a discovery of her
moral danger; because she knew that there was salvation for the
chief of sinners; but she knew that if these impressions left her
they might never return. She arose from the couch of weariness
and suffering, and stood resting on the back of her chair, while she
gave vent to her feelings in the following form of prayer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blessed Lord, it is enough! it is too much! Surely there needs
not this variety of argument, this importunity of persuasion, to court
me to be happy, to prevail on me to accept of pardon, of life, of
eternal glory. Compassionate Saviour, my soul is subdued; so that
I trust the language of my grief is become that of my submission, and
I may say, 'My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing
and give praise' (Psalm lvii. 7).</p>

<p>"O gracious Redeemer! I have already neglected thee too long.
I have too often injured thee; have crucified thee afresh by my
guilt and impenitence, as if I had taken pleasure in 'putting thee to
an open shame.' But my heart now bows itself before thee in
humble unfeigned submission. I desire to make no terms with
thee but these&mdash;that I may be entirely thine. I cheerfully present
thee with a blank, entreating thee that thou wilt do me the honour
to signify upon it what is thy pleasure. Teach me, O Lord, what thou
wouldst have me to do; for I desire to learn the lesson, and to learn
it that I may practise it. If it be more than my feeble powers can
answer, thou wilt, I hope, give me more strength; and in that
strength will I serve thee. O receive a soul which thou hast made
willing to be thine!</p>

<p>"No more, O blessed Jesus, no more is it necessary to beseech and
entreat me. Permit me, rather, to address myself to thee with all
the importunity of a perishing sinner, that at length sees and knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
'there is salvation in no other.' Permit me now, Lord, to come and
throw myself at thy feet, like a helpless outcast that has no shelter
but in thy generous compassion; like one 'pursued by the avenger
of blood,' and seeking earnestly an admittance into the 'city of
refuge.'</p>

<p>"'I wait for the Lord; my soul doth wait; and in thy word do
I hope,' that thou wilt 'receive me graciously.' My soul confides in
thy goodness, and adores it. I adore the patience which has borne
with me so long; and the grace that now makes me heartily willing
to be thine; to be thine on thine own terms, thine on any terms.
O secure this treacherous heart to thyself! O unite me to thee in
such inseparable bonds, that none of the allurements of rank, or of
fortune&mdash;none of the vanities of an ensnaring world&mdash;none of the
solicitations of sinful companions, may draw me back from thee
and plunge me into new guilt and ruin! 'Be surety, O Lord, for
thy servant for good,' that I may still keep my hold on thee; till at
length I know more fully, by joyful and everlasting experience, how
complete a Saviour thou art. Amen."</p>

<p>As she sat musing on the wondrous scene which had passed before
her, adoring the long-suffering which had borne with her follies, and
the grace which had so unexpectedly invested the truth with such
attractive and subduing power, she was roused by the entrance of
her mother. "I hope, my dear Louisa," said Mrs. Holmes, "you have
spent a more pleasant day than you anticipated." "I have been
more free from pain than usual," she replied; "and upon the whole,
the hours have passed away agreeably, though I certainly felt my
solitude to be irksome."</p>

<p>Many who have felt the renewing influence of the truth, when
looking back to the earlier periods of their history, can recal to
their remembrance some text of Scripture, an observation in a
sermon, or a remark in conversation, which had an extraordinary
effect at the time it was heard; fixing their attention as though it
spoke with commanding authority; and which may be regarded as
the first strivings of the Spirit of God within them. These sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
occurrences have served as the rallying point of hope, when the
mind has been driven to the remotest distance from the faith of
Christ; and notwithstanding the preference which may have been
given for a season to the pleasures of sin, there has been a secret inclination
for those of righteousness&mdash;God having implanted a witness
in the bosom who has never ceased to warn and to reprove.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes, when about the age of twelve years, heard Mr.
Newton make the following remark, in addressing himself to children:
"You should treasure up in your memory, while you are
young, all the religious knowledge which you can obtain, as it may
be of great service to you at some future day, when your attention
may be directed to the momentous question of your salvation. You
will then, when convinced of sin, and awed by the terrors of the
world to come, know how to obtain relief, and be kept from that
state of deep perplexity in which many are plunged, who are brought
to see their danger, while ignorant of the way of escape."</p>

<p>This judicious remark struck her with peculiar force, and ever
afterwards she listened to the preaching of the gospel, in anticipation
of the future benefit which she might derive from it. From
that moment she lived in the full expectation of the great spiritual
change, which was ultimately produced in her mind. Often, at
different periods, would she retire from the fascinations of the world
to pray for a new heart; and though she had urged her request till
hope began to wane, yet she was never permitted to despair of
obtaining the blessing. It is true, the paralyzing influence of her
new connections and habits had greatly diminished her anxieties
and solicitudes for the one thing needful; but the early impressions
of its importance which she had received, when listening to the
faithful appeals of Mr. Newton, were too deeply imprinted in her
heart ever to become obliterated; and though she usually assumed
great ease of manners, and wore the smile of complacent cheerfulness,
yet beneath these outward appearances there lay concealed a
wounded, and at times an agonized spirit. She would sometimes
join in the satirical play of wit on the eccentricities of professors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
but always discountenanced any attack on the truth or sanctity of
religion; and though she was becoming more and more conformed
to the world, yet she could not disengage herself from the influence
which the powers of the world to come had early acquired over her
judgment and her conscience. She had too much religion to be
happy with the gay, and too little to be happy with the pious; mingling
with each, yet not being able to partake of the enjoyments of
either, she was doomed to a life of perpetual mortification.</p>

<p>As her character usually received its peculiar tone and complexion
from the society with which she last associated, it was perpetually
varying from gay to grave and from grave to gay; her spirits
would occasionally rise to the highest mirth, and then sink to the
lowest depression; sometimes she appeared open and bland, at other
times reserved and gloomy; alternately devoting herself to the pleasures
of the world, and the external exercises of religion, it was
not till after she became a new creature in Christ Jesus, that her
most intimate friends could ascertain the real cause of such extraordinary
changeableness in her character.</p>

<p>The impressions of Divine truth on the heart, when produced
by a supernatural power, are deep and permanent; but when they
claim no higher origin than the agency of man, they soon pass away
like the morning cloud and early dew, and leave no trace of their
existence. They may, during their continuance, induce an order of
thought and reflection, in strict accordance with the general tenor
of the Scriptures, but they effect no real change in the heart or character.
As they bear a resemblance when they are first received,
and at successive periods, to the operations of the Holy Spirit, they
are frequently mistaken for them, and a profession of religion made
under their influence is often abandoned as soon as they subside.
Hence the annals of the Christian church record the names of many
who have outlived their avowed attachment to the faith of Christ;
and the most awful passages of the sacred volume are directed
against those who, after pleading its promises, with the hope of obtaining
eternal life, relapse into a course of worldliness or infidelity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>It was under a trembling apprehension of the transitory nature of
her religious convictions and feelings, that Miss Holmes formed a
resolution to make no reference to them, till by a process of trial she
had acquired some satisfactory evidence of their permanency. She
remembered an observation which she once heard the venerable
Newton make, when preaching on the parable of the sower:&mdash;"Genuine
religion is distinguished from that which is spurious, not so
much by the dissimilarity of its first impressions, as by its power to
resist temptation, and to bring the dispositions of the heart into subjection
to the authority of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>Her indisposition, though severe and protracted, was at no period
considered dangerous; it kept her away from the scenes of
gaiety to which she would otherwise have been exposed, and gave
her an opportunity of devoting her attention more calmly and dispassionately
to that subject which now began to appear pre-eminently
interesting and important. She knew that her sins were
more in number than she could calculate, and that the sentence of
condemnation which stood recorded against her might be executed
without any impeachment of the justice or benevolence of God; but
such was the strength of her faith in the efficacy of the Saviour's
death, and in the power of his intercession, that she "was filled with
all peace in believing, abounding in hope, through the power of the
Holy Ghost." Her transition from a state of nature to a state of
grace&mdash;from vain and passing pleasures to those of religion&mdash;from the
delusive charms of the visible to the more attractive glories of the
unseen world, was sudden, but tranquil&mdash;unattended by those deep
convictions of guilt and that overpowering apprehension of future
condemnation which sometimes torture and distract the mind of the
young disciple. This was primarily owing to the accurate knowledge
of the scheme of salvation which she had acquired by sitting
under the enlightened ministry of Mr. Newton; for while it must
not be concealed, that the beginning and consummation of personal
religion in the heart is to be attributed to the immediate action
of a supernatural power, yet it is equally evident that its progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in allaying the fear that produceth torment, in instilling the peace
which passeth all understanding, and in elevating and fixing the affections
on things above, is usually in proportion to the accuracy and
extent of the theological information which is possessed.</p>

<p>"Many," says an interesting writer, "are too prone to look for a
conversion always uniform, not only in its effects, but in its operation,
and too much bordering on the miraculous. The soul must be
first overwhelmed with fear&mdash;then pierced by grief and anguish&mdash;then
plunged into despair&mdash;then suddenly filled with hope, and
peace, and joy; and the person must be able to determine the day
on which, and the sermon, or the paragraph, or the providence by
which the change was wrought. But this is by no means necessarily,
or generally the case. There is a variety in the temperaments
and habits of men, and in the methods employed to bring
them to repentance. We should remember that there are differences
of administration, but the same Lord; that often he prefers to
the earthquake, the wind, and the fire, the small still voice; that he
can draw by the cords of love and the bands of a man; that he can
work as effectually by slow as by instantaneous exertions; and that
he may change the soul in a manner so gradual and mild, as to be
scarcely discernible to any but the glorious Author. And here we
are furnished with evidence from analogy. In nature some of God's
works insensibly issue in others, and it is impossible for us to draw
the line of distinction. The path of the just is as the shining light,
which shineth more and more unto the perfect day. But who can
ascertain which ray begins, or which ends the dawn? If you are
unable to trace the progress of the Divine life, judge by the result.
When you perceive the effects of conversion, never question the
cause. And if perplexed by a number of circumstantial inquiries,
be satisfied if you are able to say, One thing I know, that whereas I
was once blind, now I see."</p>

<p>The chastened seriousness of spirit which Miss Holmes exhibited,
and the new course of reading which she adopted, induced the family
to suppose that she was taking a religious turn, though she cautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
abstained from making any reference to it. She felt convinced that
some essential change had taken place, yet at times she doubted if it
was anything more than the effect of her own spontaneous thoughts
and reflections; and as she had, more than once, experienced a mental
excitement of a similar nature, she rejoiced with trembling. She
knew that the righteous hold on their way, because they are kept
by the power of God through faith unto salvation; but as she was
often perplexed, when endeavouring to ascertain whether she belonged
to that specific denomination of character, she could not anticipate
the issue of her impressions with unmingled satisfaction.
She felt a distaste for those objects of pursuit and sources of gratification
which had acquired such a powerful ascendency over her;
and now she longed to partake of the more refined enjoyment which
results from communion with the members of the household of faith
and the public exercises of devotion; but she dreaded the prospect
of coming into contact with the world, lest another relapse of feeling
should take place, which would leave her still more insensible than
ever to the unseen realities of eternity.</p>

<p>The Saviour, in his various offices, was now precious to her, as he
is to all them that believe. She dwelt with holy awe and delight
on that union of majesty and condescension, purity and compassion,
justice and grace, which he displays in his mediatorial character;
but she was apprehensive, that when exposed to the rival influence
of temporal pursuits, her mind would again be enslaved by their
charms, and she would lose the relish she now felt for her new
themes of contemplation and enjoyment.</p>

<p>Thus it is wisely ordained, that at every period in the experience
of the Christian, there shall be some circumstances to perplex his
judgment&mdash;some uncertainty to darken his prospect&mdash;some apprehensions
to disturb his peace, to convince him that here 'perfect bliss
cannot be found;' and that no attainments, however high&mdash;that no
anticipations, however bright and animating&mdash;are capable, while we
are encompassed with infirmities, of yielding unmingled satisfaction
and delight. At times Miss Holmes felt very anxious to disclose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
some one the change through which her mind was now passing, that
she might have the advantage of Christian sympathy and guidance;
but the perplexing question was, to whom should she make the
communication. She often thought of speaking to her mother, but
when she made the attempt, her courage failed her. At length she
addressed the following letter to her friend Mrs. Loader, who had
evinced so much solicitude for her spiritual welfare:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">"The Elms</span>, <em>16th Oct., 18&mdash;</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged by your affectionate
epistle, which I received on the 10th; and I regret that you should
deem any apology necessary for the introduction of that specific advice
which it contains. My obvious indifference to the momentous
question of personal religion, and my growing conformity to the
customs and habits of the gay world, must, I have no doubt, have
given you very considerable uneasiness; and I assure you that it
often plunged me into the deepest depression of spirit. I was often
cheerful, but never happy; often trying fresh expedients to divert
my attention from what I deemed <em>the gloomy subject</em>, but never
could succeed; and though I became more insensible to the attractions
of religion as I grew in years, yet I exposed myself more frequently
to the keenness of its reproofs and the awful terrors of its
threatenings. My associates, who had not had the privilege of a pious
education, could enjoy the world, and treat with levity the prohibitory
injunctions of the Scriptures, but I could not. I never could
divest myself of the full conviction that God has the first claim on
the affections of the heart; and that he has appointed a day when
every human being 'must appear before the judgment-seat of Christ;
that every one may receive the things done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.' These thoughts
would rush into my mind, not only when alone, but also when in
the midst of the gayest company, and by no expedient could I succeed
in driving them away.</p>

<p>"It was under the most agonizing mental conflict I ever sustained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that I hailed our tour to the west as likely to dissolve the fatal
charm by which I was subdued and enslaved; but I found, on my
return, that my <em>heart</em> had undergone no change, as I often secretly
anticipated a re-entrance into those scenes which my conscience so
severely condemned. I once heard Mr. Newton remark, that as
our dangers often spring out of our comforts, so the greatest blessings
sometimes grow out of our heaviest afflictions. The correctness
of this remark I can <em>now</em> attest from experience. It was on
our return from Devonshire that I met with the accident which has
confined me a close prisoner for more than two months; but to that
accident which I called disastrous, I owe all my present happiness
and my prospect of eternal glory.</p>

<p>"You express a hope that I have given the book which you so
kindly presented to me, a candid perusal, presuming that no season
can be more favourable for such subjects of inquiry than those
which we denominate afflictive. Yes, my dear friend, I have read
it, though I felt such a reluctance to do so that I put it from me
several times; and had not my word stood pledged to read it, I had
still been a stranger to its soul-stirring contents. I read on carelessly
till I came to the tenth chapter, when the subject fixed my
attention, and I hope penetrated my heart. Then I <em>felt</em> that I was
a sinner&mdash;then I <em>felt</em> that I stood solitary and alone, in the immediate
presence of my Legislator and my Judge, confounded, because
righteously condemned&mdash;then I <em>felt</em> that I needed a Saviour. I have
had many strong convictions of the truth and the necessity of religion
in the earlier seasons of my life; but those produced on this
occasion were more clear, and full, and impressive, than any that
ever preceded them. They came with an authority which I could
not resist; they prevented all vacillation of mind, and constrained
me, with a force which I had no disposition to withstand, to yield to
their power; and though my evil heart of unbelief would sometimes
suggest that all is a delusion, artfully practised on my imagination
by Satan, who sometimes transforms himself into an angel of
light, yet I can say, in reference to Him who is the chief among ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
thousand&mdash;'Whom having not seen, I love; in whom, though now
I see him not, yet believing, I rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
of glory.'</p>

<p>"When, my dear friend, I received that present from your hand,
I did not calculate on the effects which it was ordained to produce;
for though I feel unworthy of the notice of the Friend of sinners,
yet, on reviewing the recent change which has taken place in my
sentiments, my taste, and my feelings, I cannot avoid ascribing it to
his sovereign and predetermined will. But though I am fully convinced
that a great change has been produced, yet I must not conceal
from you the dread I sometimes feel lest it should prove only a
momentary excitement. I now can see the vanity of the world;
but shall I do so when I am again able to go about? I now can
consecrate myself to the service of the Redeemer; but shall I have
courage to take up the cross and follow him, when again enticed to
mingle with the gay votaries of fashion? It is not my province to
dictate to infinite Wisdom, nor prescribe the method by which my
religious principles shall be tried; but it is my earnest, and my
daily prayer, to be kept within the walls of my solitary retreat, till
He whose I am, and whom I wish to serve, has prepared me to resist
every temptation by which I may be assailed, and to perform
every duty which may devolve upon me.</p>

<p>"Now that I have given you this explanation, you will doubtless
be able to account for that singular variation in my disposition
and manners, which you must have so often noticed; but
if you had known the strange revulsion of feeling to which my
poor unhappy mind was perpetually subjected, you would have considered
it as perfectly natural. I am by nature a child of imitation&mdash;apt
to catch the spirit and temper of those with whom I come
into contact&mdash;easily captivated by imposing manners&mdash;averse to all
appearance of singularity&mdash;volatile and impetuous in my disposition;
yet at the early age of twelve, I was so powerfully impressed
with the truth and necessity of personal piety, that I do not think
I ever spent a day without giving it my most serious attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Hence, when carried away by the example of others to scenes of
gaiety, my spirits would naturally rise to a high pitch of feeling,
yet on returning to my graver and more important subjects of reflection,
I felt so abased and confounded&mdash;so terrified and alarmed
in prospect of futurity, that I could scarcely endure the anguish I
was doomed to suffer. I do not know that I can better describe the
state of my mind, than by quoting the language of Dr. Watts, with
a few slight alterations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I was a helpless captive, sold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Under the power of sin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not do the good I would,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor keep my conscience clean.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My God, I cry'd with fervent breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For some kind power to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break the yoke of sin and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thus redeem the slave.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The charge which is often brought against religion, as tending
to abridge our comforts, and induce a melancholy and dejection of
spirit, I can repel from experience. Infallible Truth declares, that
her ways are ways of pleasantness, and her paths are paths of peace;
and now I know, and feel it. My mind, which has been tossed
about on the surging billows of doubt and perplexity, has at last
gained that haven of rest, where, I trust, it is destined to remain.</p>

<p>"No one of my family has any knowledge of the present state of
my feelings, as I have cautiously abstained from making any allusion
to religious subjects; not because I am ashamed of religion, but
because I am unwilling to make a premature profession; and though
perhaps you may censure me for withholding from my dear parents
a communication which is so calculated to give them pleasure, yet if
I should be permitted, after having made it, to relapse into my former
course of gaiety and folly, the disappointment will be so great
that it may entail on them perpetual sorrow. Pray that I may be
kept in the evil hour&mdash;that I may be enabled to walk circumspectly
towards them that are without&mdash;that I may have courage to make
a profession of my attachment to the Lord Jesus, and grace to adorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
it, and at length be presented faultless before the presence of his
glory, with exceeding joy.</p>

<p>"I need not say how acceptable another letter from you would
be; but I certainly should prefer a personal interview, if you could
make it convenient to pay us a visit. I am happy to inform you
that I am much better, and that all the rest of the family are well.&mdash;Yours
affectionately,</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>"To Mrs. Loader."</p></blockquote>

<p>True piety does not act to be seen of men, nor speak to gain their
applause; but though for a season it may remain unobserved, yet
the meekness of its spirit and the lustre of its character are marks
by which it will always indubitably be known. For the reasons
which have been previously assigned, Miss Holmes had abstained
from communicating to her family the change which had taken
place in her sentiments and feelings; but she was not able to conceal
from them the external proofs of it which her conduct and her
occasional conversation necessarily supplied. As she was reserved
on the subject, so were her parents; and though they felt anxious
to ascertain if her great seriousness of manners was anything more
than a recurrence of her former deep depression of spirit, yet they
knew not how to do it.</p>

<p>It often happens that young persons can make a more free statement
of their religious experience to strangers or distant friends
than they can to their own parents; but this in general argues some
essential defect in the bringing up and arrangements of the family.
There may be, I grant, on the part of the child, in the earlier stages
of his experience, a reluctance to disclose to any one "the secret
movements and operations of his heart towards the best of Beings;"
but if Christian parents were to incorporate, in their course of religious
instruction, the habit of a free and unreserved conversation
on the practical effects of truth, and if they would occasionally retire
with their children, to pray <em>with them</em> and <em>for them</em>, specifically
and alone, it would imperceptibly beget such a union and intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of spirit, that <em>they</em> would be no less anxious to unburden to them
the anxieties and sorrows of their heart, than the parent would feel
delighted to become their spiritual counsellor and friend.</p>

<p>When Miss Holmes was sitting with her mother, one Sabbath
evening, an allusion happened to be made to the sermon which had
been preached at church, and with which Mrs. Holmes expressed her
dissatisfaction. "Perhaps," remarked Louisa, "it would be difficult
to procure a more pleasant residence than our own, or one which is
more conducive to our general health; but I assure you that I often
deplore the consequences which must inevitably result, from our
being deprived of the privilege of attending an evangelical ministry."</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure, my dear, to hear you deplore the loss of
such a privilege, as it is a proof that you value it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mamma, I do value it, but now, alas! I have no prospect
of enjoying it. Yet I feel more for others, than I feel for myself,
especially for the junior members of our family; as I fear, now that
they are removed from the restraints which pure evangelical truth
imposes on the heart and conscience, they will devote themselves to
the pleasures of the world, which will give them a distaste for those
of religion."</p>

<p>"And does my dear Louisa then prefer the pleasures of religion to
those of the world?"</p>

<p>"I trust, Mamma, I do; though I am almost afraid to speak with
confidence on such a delicate and important question. I know from
past experience, that there may be deep religious impressions, and
powerful religious excitement, even while the heart retains all its
evil propensities and antipathies; but I hope it hath pleased God
to employ my late affliction as the means of bringing me into fellowship
with himself, and his Son Jesus Christ. I murmured when
he smote me, but now I can say, 'I know, O Lord, that thy judgments
are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy
word.'"</p>

<p>"Both your father and I have thought," said Mrs. Holmes, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
God was dealing graciously with your soul, and we have often
prayed that you might come out of this affliction a new creature in
Christ Jesus; yet we could not overcome the strange reluctance we
felt to speak to you on the subject; but as it hath pleased God to
answer our prayers, I must convey the glad tidings to your father,
who will embrace you as one alive from the dead."</p>

<p>"As you have drawn me into a premature disclosure on this subject,
I certainly cannot object to your communicating to my dear
father the substance of our conversation, but I must request that
you will take no notice of it to any other person. For if I should
now make a profession of religion, and on the return of health and
energy, should relapse into my former course of gaiety and folly, I
shall do essential injury to others."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, you may be 'confident of this very thing, that he
which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day
of Jesus Christ.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, that when the work of grace is begun, it will be
carried on, notwithstanding the various impediments which may
obstruct its progress, or the artifices which may be employed by the
great adversary to effect its destruction; but I am not quite satisfied
that what I feel <em>is</em> the work of grace. It may be nothing more than
the effect of my own fears; and if so, it will disappear as soon as
they subside; or it may be the necessary consequence of that train
of serious thought and reflection, which a lengthened indisposition
generally originates; and if so, every trace of its existence will be
obliterated, when I again intermingle in the pursuits of active life."</p>

<p>"But have you not, my dear Louisa, <em>tasted</em> that the Lord is
gracious, as well as <em>felt</em> his terrors which have made you afraid?
and can you, on cool reflection, suppose that He will ever abandon
you, now that you have surrendered your heart to him?"</p>

<p>"I have felt none of the terrors of religion, which may be an
essential defect in my experience; and the excitements which I have
ascribed to the love of God shed abroad in my heart by the power of
the Holy Ghost, may prove the momentary joy of the stony-ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hearer, in whom the seed of truth could not thrive, because it took
no root. If, after a period of trial, I am induced to believe that I
have felt the renovating power of Divine grace, I trust that I shall
then have courage given me to make a decided profession of the
faith of Christ, without regarding the remarks to which it may subject
me; but till then, it is my earnest wish, that you intrust to
no one but my dear father the communication which I have almost
unintentionally made to you. I have seen so many throw off their
religious profession, and return to the course which they had abandoned;
and I have such a dread of apostasy, that it is my fixed
determination to have some practical proof of the efficacy of my
principles to resist temptation, and bring the dispositions of my
heart into subjection to the authority of Jesus Christ, before I make
any profession."</p>

<p>"I approve, my dear, of your decision; but while jealous of yourself,
you must guard against mistrusting the faithfulness and loving-kindness
of God your Saviour, who has pledged his honour to keep
you by his power through faith unto salvation."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_170.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The scene which opens on the imagination of the young
Christian is often so beautiful and enchanting&mdash;it so
deeply fixes his attention, and enchains his affections&mdash;that
he turns with an eye of comparative indifference
from the objects and pursuits to which he has been previously devoted,
under a full conviction that they cannot <em>now</em> yield him the
gratification they once did; and that he cannot <em>now</em> derive permanent
happiness, except from that new source of felicity which he has discovered.
It is, when he is under these novel and powerful impressions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
that the long neglected Bible discloses new beauties; no theme
of meditation or discussion presents any subduing charm in comparison
with Christ Jesus, and him crucified; and having felt the transition
from a state of spiritual death to a newness of life, to be attended
by such hallowed emotions, he is in danger of anticipating
too large a portion of spiritual enjoyment, which not unfrequently
becomes the occasion of great mental perplexity, and sometimes of
deep depression.</p>
</div>

<p>During the continuance of her indisposition Miss Holmes felt so
intensely interested in reading her Bible, that she might clearly understand
the sublime theory of the Christian faith, and so absorbed
in her spiritual exercises, that her health sustained some injury by
the severity of her application. As a very natural consequence, a
shade of melancholy was cast over her spirit. She was forewarned
of the possibility of such an effect being produced; but the usual
apology which she made to her pious mother was, "Can I take too
much interest in that important subject, into which angels desire to
look? or can I ever hope for a more favourable time for its investigation
than the present, when I am precluded from mingling in the
employments or the amusements of the world?"</p>

<p>The following form of self-dedication to God she now drew up
and signed, having vowed in the most solemn manner to observe
it to the full extent of her pledge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eternal and unchangeable Jehovah! thou glorious Creator of
heaven and earth, and adorable Lord of angels and men, I desire
with the deepest humiliation and abasement of soul, to bow down
at this time in thine awful presence, and earnestly pray, that thou
wilt impress my heart with a clear perception of thine unutterable
and inconceivable glories.</p>

<p>"To thee do I now come, invited by the exceeding great and precious
promises of thy Word; trusting for acceptance in the efficacy
of the Saviour's death, beseeching thee to 'be merciful unto me a
sinner.' The irregular propensities of my depraved nature have in
ten thousand aggravated instances wrought to bring forth fruit unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
death. And if thou shouldst be strict to mark my offences, I must
be silent under a load of guilt, and immediately sink into destruction.
But thou hast graciously called me to return to thee, though
I have been a backsliding child. I come unto thee, O Lord, convinced
not only of my sin, but of my folly; and while I implore
mercy through the mediation of Jesus Christ, I would be no less
importunate for the purifying influences of the Holy Spirit, that I
may be entirely conformed to thee. Permit me to bring unto thee
those powers and faculties which I have ungratefully alienated from
thy service; and receive, I beseech thee, thy poor revolted creature,
who is now convinced of thy right to her, and who desires nothing
in the world so much as to be thine.</p>

<p>"I bring to thee a dark benighted mind, to be illuminated with
Divine knowledge. Thou hast the words of eternal life; I therefore
resign my understanding to thy teaching. I bring to thee a corrupt
and deceitful heart; do thou cleanse and make it upright before
thee. Do thou expel all the evils which lurk within it, and make it
a temple for thyself. May the same mind which was in Christ
Jesus be in me. May I possess the same humility which he displayed,
the same indifference to the riches and the pleasures of the
world, the same spirit of zeal for thine honour, and of benevolence
towards man. May I ever wear the ornament of a meek and quiet
spirit; be enabled to adorn the profession which I hope to make;
and finally be admitted into the kingdom of my Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"And I do now most solemnly give myself unto thee, as one whom
thou hast made alive from the dead, with a firm and unalterable
determination to live devoted to thee; loving thee supremely, walking
in thy fear, and glorifying thee in my body and my spirit, which
are thine."</p>

<p>The practice of self-dedication, which is often recommended to
the young Christian, may tend to increase his reverence for God,
and to make him more watchful over his own spirit; but unless he
has very clear perceptions of the way of salvation, it may be productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of essential spiritual injury. For though we are told in the
most express language, that "we are saved by grace through faith,
and that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest
any man should boast;" yet when the distinction between obedience,
as the fruit of faith, and obedience as the hope of reward, is not accurately
and perpetually observed, there is a danger of contracting
a self-righteous spirit, which by aiming at personal perfection for
ostentatious display, or as a source of mental confidence, may bring
the soul into a state of spiritual bondage.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes having most solemnly dedicated herself to God, and
formed a sanguine opinion of the high capabilities of the renewed
mind, began to prescribe a set of rules for her self-government,
which she resolved to observe. If these rules had related merely to
her conduct in social life, she might have kept them; but as they
included the regulation of the disposition, and the frame of her
mind towards God, they were founded on a mistaken conception
of her own ability. They imperceptibly diverted her attention from
the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ, by faith in which sinners
are accepted and justified, to a laborious effort to attain a high degree
of sinless excellence; and as she progressively discovered so many,
and such lamentable defects in her obedience, the peace of mind
which she enjoyed when "first she knew the Lord" was destroyed,
and she gradually sunk into a state of despondency. By making
this fatal, yet common mistake, she was led to the conclusion, that
the attainments of the genuine Christian were placed beyond her
reach, and that it would be an act of presumption if she attempted
to acquire them.</p>

<p>An evangelical ministry is instituted to promote the edification of
them that believe, no less than to convert sinners from the error of
their ways; to guard them against those misconceptions of truth,
which may prove injurious to their happiness and spiritual prosperity;
and to explain that mysteriousness which rests over their earlier
experience, when there is a constant, and often a rapid interchange
of hope and of fear, of sorrow and of joy, of a bright prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
future blessedness, and a foreboding apprehension of future woe.
Those who attend such a ministry, partake of the advantages of it,
without being conscious of the benefit which they receive; but if
indisposition, or any other circumstance, prevent a Christian from
availing himself of this ordinance of grace, he may linger for a long
time, especially in the earlier stages of the spiritual life, in a state of
great mental perplexity, and may gradually sink into a morbid depression,
without being able either to remove or account for it.</p>

<p>Domestic engagements prevented Mrs. Loader from paying a visit
to the Elms; but the following letter is a proof of the deep interest
which she took in the welfare of her friend, and also of her ability to
give her judicious counsel:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Louisa</span>,&mdash;I am fearful lest you should construe my
silence into indifference; but I flatter myself, that the following explanation
will protect me from such an imputation. I was from
home when yours of last month arrived; and since my return,
family matters so engaged my attention, that I have been prevented
replying to it. It is impossible for words to express the pleasure
I felt on the perusal of your first very interesting letter; and
though the degree of that pleasure was somewhat diminished on the
reception of your second, yet I cannot refrain from offering you my
sincere congratulations, on account of what the Lord has done for
you, and is still doing. Clouds and darkness are often round about
him, while he is silently and unobserved carrying on his own work;
and when it is not in our power to trace the operation of his hand,
we are required to stand still, and he will show us his salvation. In
the early experience of the Christian there are many circumstances
which perplex and confound him, and which appear to place his
good hope in the most imminent danger; but it is the province of
faith calmly to wait the issue, which is certain, and will be glorious.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised, my dear Louisa, that you should regret
having made what you call a premature disclosure of your Christian
experience, especially as you begin to entertain some strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
doubts of its being genuine. This is very natural, and very common.
If the experimental influence of the truth fell under the
immediate observation of our senses, we should be able to mark its
progress with the most perfect accuracy; but as the seat of its first
and most powerful operations is the heart&mdash;that province which the
eye can never penetrate; and as it merely diffuses itself over the
exercise of our intellectual and moral faculties, without acting alone,
and independently of them, we almost necessarily, at times, suspect
whether we have ever felt it. It is true, we may see a change in our
conduct, and a change in the disposition and temper of our mind;
but as this uniformly takes place in consequence of our full conviction
of its propriety, we may, especially in a gloomy hour, be incapable
of tracing it up to a supernatural cause.</p>

<p>"The first impressions of Divine truth on the heart are generally
strong and deep&mdash;they produce a powerful excitement of
the affections; and such is the intense degree of interest which is
sometimes felt at such a period, that no variation is anticipated,
except it be some higher and more blissful elevation of soul&mdash;some
ascent to a spiritual Pisgah, from whence the lot of our future inheritance
with the saints in light may be clearly seen. But when
the mind becomes more familiar with the sublime truths of religion,
they lose somewhat of their novelty; and though they still retain
their ascendency over the judgment, yet the impressions which they
produce become less powerful. This change in the feelings often
induces the young Christian to suspect, that the cause of its original
production must be found, not in the grace of God, but the uninfluenced
operations of his own faculties and passions. It is when
the mind is thus variously exercised, that the invisible enemy of our
peace often comes to augment our perplexity, by insinuating, that
if we were renewed, the fact of our renovation would be so conspicuous,
that we could never doubt it&mdash;that if we did really love
the Lord, our love would glow with undiminished ardour&mdash;that if
our faith were genuine, we should never be permitted to stagger
at any of the promises of God through unbelief&mdash;that if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
made partakers of the Divine nature, we should for ever escape the
corruption that is in the world&mdash;and if our spiritual emotions were
actually produced by the operation of a supernatural power, they
would neither subside nor fluctuate.</p>

<p>"If then, my dear Louisa, you should doubt, where others have
doubted before you, and if you should feel those causes of perplexity
and depression operating on your mind, under which the faithful in
Christ Jesus in every age have laboured, you ought to comfort
yourself by the reflection that you are now passing through the
usual trials of Christian experience. If you had no doubts, you
would have cause to fear; and if you knew no change of feeling,
you would have cause to suspect your change of heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come then&mdash;a still, small whisper in your ear,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>She</em> has no hope, who never had a fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <em>she</em> that never doubted of <em>her</em> state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>She</em> may perhaps&mdash;perhaps <em>she</em> may, too late.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I am happy to find, by your last letter, that you have disclosed
the state of your mind to your dear parents; for while I certainly
approve of the motive which induced you to conceal it from them,
yet I think you have acted wisely in breaking through your resolution.
As they so often wept over you, when you were living without
God, and without Christ in the world; and have, with so much
fervour, intermingled their supplications at the footstool of the
Divine throne for your conversion, it would have been an act of
unkindness to have kept them in a state of ignorance on a subject
in which they are so deeply interested. You should communicate
to them not only the general fact, that you are <em>now become 'a fellow-heir
of the grace of life,'</em> but also the perplexities which disquiet and
depress you, as they are so well qualified to give you that instruction
and consolation which you may require. It is by giving vent
to the feelings of the soul, that we gain relief from our most poignant
griefs; and though you perhaps can more readily communicate your
experience to an absent friend than to your own parents, yet, if you
make the effort, the barrier which obstructs an unreserved disclosure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of all you feel, and all you fear, will soon be broken down, and then
your spiritual intercourse will be free and unfettered. It will
require, on your part, I have no doubt, a great sacrifice of feeling,
to take the step which I now venture to recommend; but you know
who has said, My grace shall be sufficient for thee&mdash;as thy day, thy
strength shall be; and if you by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving, make your request unto Him, He will give you wisdom
and strength to follow the advice I now offer.</p>

<p>"I have often regretted your removal from London, especially
when I found that you are not favoured with an evangelical ministry
in the church. This circumstance must operate as a serious drawback
upon your social happiness; and now you are brought to feel
the importance of religion, I am not surprised that you should deeply
deplore it. You ask me what you are to do, now you are able to
attend public worship. This is an important question, but I feel no
hesitation in giving you the advice which I have given to others,
who have been placed in similar circumstances. If there be no Dissenting
chapel within a convenient distance, in which the gospel is
preached, go to your parish church as usual, to avoid the appearance
of Sabbath profanation; but if there be one, I think it your duty to
attend there. I do not recommend you to secede, for the mere sake
of secession; but for your spiritual improvement, which will depend
more on a pure evangelical ministry, than any other secondary cause.
Some, I am aware, would urge you to prefer your parish church to
a Dissenting chapel, even if the minister be an irreligious man, and
to stay there till it shall please God to introduce the gospel into it;
but as it is not in my power to reconcile such advice with the injunction
of our Lord, <em>Take heed what ye hear</em>, you cannot expect that I
can approve of such a course. The eminently devout Christian loves
the habitation of the Lord's house, and the place where his honour
dwelleth; but we have no reason to believe that God visits any
place with the manifestations of his love, where the minister does
not preach salvation by grace through faith. But suffer the word
of exhortation. You are now coming out amongst the difficulties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a public profession of religion; one friend may recommend you to
adopt one plan, and another, another; and the more you consult, the
more you may be perplexed, till at length you may be incapable of
coming to any decision. To obviate this evil, go and meditate seriously
on the following passage&mdash;'Trust in the Lord with all thine
heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways
acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.' Reduce to practice
the admonition of the wise man, and you will find that the Lord
will give wisdom, as well as strength.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged by your kind invitation to the Elms, and intend,
as soon as I can leave home, to pay you a visit, when I hope
to find you in perfect health. Remember me very kindly to every
member of your family, and believe me to be, yours affectionately,</p>

<span class="smcap">E. Loader</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most common-place charges which is brought against
evangelical religion, is, that it has a tendency to make its possessor
melancholy; and if we were to form our judgment of it from the
appearance and manner of some who profess it, we should be disposed
to admit its correctness. They not only abstain from all the
pleasures and amusements of the social circle; but habitually wear
a gloom on their countenance, which indicates a singular dejection
and moroseness of spirit. But this dejection of spirit, which we may
sometimes discover in a professor of evangelical religion, is not produced
by his religious principles, but by his sense of personal guilt,
and his want of that assurance of forgiveness, which the gospel of
Jesus Christ is intended to convey. He may be permitted to remain
for a season, by the Holy One of Israel, whose laws he has
violated, and whom he has neglected to glorify, under the sentence
of self-condemnation; but when he is enabled to rely on the atonement
made by Jesus Christ, and to appropriate the promise of mercy,
he enjoys the peace which passeth all understanding. If then, we
wish to form a correct estimate of the real tendency of evangelical
truth, we must not go to the penitent sinner while he is suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
under the deep convictions of guilt, as then he is more prone to put
from him the words of consolation, than to embrace them; but we
must go to the established believer, who, having received the truth
in the love of it, is enjoying its sacred and blissful influence. He
will repel the charge as a libel on his faith, and unblushingly avow,
that he never knew solid and substantial happiness till he derived it
from communion with God, through the mediation of Jesus Christ,
and a hope of being presented faultless in his immediate presence.
And though the spirit of scepticism, which is so prevalent in all
ranks of society, may ridicule such an avowal, as a delusion
attempted to be practised on human credulity, yet surely no one,
on reflection, can presume to say that a Christian is not competent
to bear testimony to a fact of his own experience. The religious
principles which he has embraced, are represented by those who
have never felt their influence, as having a tendency to make their
possessor melancholy; and yet he declares that he has had more
mental satisfaction since he embraced them than he ever had before.
Whose testimony shall we admit to be most conclusive?&mdash;the
testimony of those who are entirely ignorant of the subject, or of
those whose knowledge qualifies them to speak? Suppose, for
example, a question to arise respecting the excellencies or defects
of a piece of music, we should not venture to place any dependence
on the opinion of a man who has no taste for the science. If
we did, we should expose ourselves to ridicule or contempt. On
such a question we should require the opinion of a competent judge;
and I appeal to the sound sense of my readers, if they can allow
those persons to pronounce a judgment on the tendency of religion
who have never felt its holy influence on the heart. They may express
their opinion, and they often do express it, but of what value
or importance is it in relation to the subject? They may say that
its tendency is to make us unhappy; but how can they prove it?
Not certainly by appealing to the obvious design of Christianity,
for that has been so unequivocally announced by the celestial messengers,
that we cannot misconceive it. "And the angel said unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the
city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And suddenly
there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising
God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good-will toward men." And if they venture to appeal to the experience
of the religious man, he candidly says, "I am happy; but my
happiness differs from yours, it takes its rise from a different source,
and possesses qualities which are peculiarly its own; it is more pure,
more exquisite, more substantial, because more intellectual and spiritual
than yours. My happiness is the peace that passeth all understanding."
But when we mention peace, we mean not the stupid
security of a mind that refuses to reflect; we mean a tranquillity
which rests on a tried and durable basis&mdash;a peace which, founded
on the oath and promise of Him who cannot lie, and springing from
the consciousness of an ineffable alliance with the Father of spirits,
makes us to share in his fulness, and become a partner with him in
his purity; a repose serene as the unruffled wave, which reflects the
heaven from its bosom, while it is accompanied with a feeling of exultation
and triumph, natural to such as are conscious that ere long,
having overcome, they shall possess all things.</p>

<p>There are many periods in the history of human life, when the
power of religious principles over the mind commands the respect,
and excites the admiration of the most inveterate infidel. Go and
see the poor Christian, contented amidst his privations&mdash;the suffering
Christian, patient under his protracted affliction&mdash;the dying
Christian, resigned and happy in prospect of his approaching dissolution;
and if you do not pay a spontaneous homage to the influence
of the principles which have such an effect in elevating and supporting
the soul of man, when visited by these direful calamities, it must
be referred either to a want of taste, or to a want of judgment.</p>

<h2>DOUBTS AND PERPLEXITIES.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The change which had taken place in Miss Holmes,
became the topic of general conversation in the circle
of her gay associates; and though some of them predicted
that she would again appear amongst them,
when "the fit of melancholy" was over, their anticipations were disappointed.
She returned the calls of inquiry as soon as her health
permitted; but she left a deep impression on the mind of all her
friends, that worldly pleasures had lost their charms for her, and
that other and nobler objects of pursuit now engrossed her attention.
One of the first proofs of her decision, was consenting to
become secretary to a female branch of an Auxiliary Bible Society,
which was established in the vicinity of the Elms, and which brought
her into immediate connection with several pious families. Having
derived so much spiritual benefit from the Scriptures during her
long confinement, she felt anxious that they should be universally
circulated; and voluntarily devoted a large portion of her time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
her influence to secure the co-operation of others in accomplishing
this important object.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most conspicuous professors in her neighbourhood was
a Mr. Corrie, whose father had attended the ministry of Romaine,
and transmitted to his son a profound veneration for the memory of
that distinguished clergyman. He was a widower, rather advanced
in life, a man of wealth; and had residing with him two unmarried
sisters. These ladies were amiable and intelligent&mdash;zealous and active
in the cause of humanity and religion&mdash;and their chief delight
was in going about doing good. Mr. Corrie usually spent the forenoon
in his study, while his sisters went forth on their visits of
mercy to the cottages of the poor; and they generally passed their
evenings in agreeable and profitable conversation, or in reading to
each other. They often read a portion of Mr. Romaine's Works,
which they considered the standard of orthodoxy; and though they
were willing to submit every religious opinion to the test of Scripture,
yet they never thought of subjecting his opinions to such an
ordeal. His treatises on the Life and Triumph of Faith, and some
Letters which have been published since his decease, they regarded
with almost as much reverence as the Epistles of the inspired writers;
believing that no author equalled him in correctness of sentiment
and depth of experience.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes, in her perambulations on behalf of the Bible Society,
happened to call on the Misses Corrie, to solicit their subscriptions,
just as they were sitting down to tea; and being pressed to remain,
she consented to spend the evening with them. Their cheerfulness&mdash;the
spirituality of mind which they discovered in their conversation&mdash;the
fervent spirit of devotion which was apparent in Mr. Corrie
when engaged in family prayer&mdash;and the confidence with which they
spoke of their interest in Christ, operated so powerfully on her feelings,
that she remained with them much longer than she intended;
and when the lateness of the hour compelled her to leave, she could
not do so without requesting permission to repeat her visit. "We
shall be happy to see you at any time," said Miss Corrie; "and if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
be in our power to teach you the way of the Lord more perfectly,
we shall consider ourselves highly honoured."</p>

<p>Religious conversation is one of the most useful methods of instruction
and consolation we can employ; but sometimes, when a
false standard of experience is adopted, it becomes the means of
perplexing and distracting inquiring minds. Our Lord taught his
disciples, as they were able to receive instruction; keeping alive
their attention, while he allayed the restlessness of an unprofitable
curiosity, by saying&mdash;"I have yet many things to say unto you, but
ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth,
is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of
himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he
will shew you things to come." And on this wise maxim the Holy
Spirit condescends to conduct His process of instruction, that we
may not be confounded by communications which we are unable to
understand; but be led on step after step in the province of Divine
knowledge, till we are "able to comprehend with all saints, what is
the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the
love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that we may be filled with
all the fulness of God." And it is of great importance, in relation
to the government of our conduct towards others, and for our own
tranquillity and spiritual improvement, that we rigorously adhere to
the same maxim; or we may inflict a wound, while attempting to impart
the consolations of our faith, and absolutely retard that growth
in knowledge which we are anxious to cultivate and advance.</p>

<p>Mr. Corrie was eminently pious, but a man of rather weak understanding,
and who had associated with but few intelligent Christians
in the earlier part of his life. His first undigested thoughts
had grown up into firm and immoveable opinions; and though he
devoted a large portion of his time to reading the Scriptures, yet,
owing to the bias of which he was not conscious, he more frequently
searched for passages in support of his own peculiar notions, than
studied them to enlarge his views of the entire scheme of Divine
truth. He was positive, but not perverse; inflexibly attached to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
own belief, but not disposed to inveigh against that of another; and
though he imbibed some religious opinions which have done great
injury to the dignity and the amiability of the Christian character,
yet in him their tendency was neutralized by the sweetness of his
natural disposition and the fervour of his devotional spirit. He
dwelt much on the high points of election and predestination; maintained
with great pertinacity that human nature undergoes no moral
improvement, but remains as impure and deceitful after the great
change has taken place, as it was before; and he considered an assurance
of our final salvation so essential to the nature of faith, that he
would not regard as a true believer a person who did not enjoy an
unclouded prospect of eternal glory. These topics bounded the range
of his inquiry; and though at times he would unawares make concessions
which compromised their accuracy, yet when apprized of
his danger, he would step back with singular adroitness, and resist
the force of an argument to expose their fallacy, by saying to an antagonist,
"<em>You</em> see through a glass darkly, while I see face to face."
If these opinions had been confined within the circle of his own
family, and the few pious friends who were of the same theological
school, he would have done no injury, as their devotional spirit and
habits would have proved a safeguard against their pernicious tendency.
But by bringing them forward in promiscuous company,
and by holding them up as essential articles of the Christian faith,
he often involved the judgment of the young disciple in great
perplexity, and unintentionally threw down some of those barriers
which the Scriptures have raised to restrain the evil propensities
of our nature. The effects of these opinions on the mind of Miss
Holmes may be seen in the following letter, which she addressed to
her friend Mrs. Loader, a few weeks after her introduction to this
family:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I should have replied earlier to your last
letter; but since my convalescence I have been so engaged with my
new duties, as the secretary to our Auxiliary Bible Society, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
have not been able to find time. I cannot express to you in words,
how much pleasure I derived from your communication. It came at
a season when my mind was sinking into despondency, and when I
was tempted to give up my hope; but the Lord was pleased to employ
it as the means of dispersing the darkness which was hovering
around me, and I was enabled to rejoice once more in the light
of his countenance. I had gained that elevated spot&mdash;that spiritual
Pisgah, to which you so beautifully allude; from whence I could
read</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'My title clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mansions in the skies;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">and from whence I thought I should never be displaced; but alas!
I am again compelled to give utterance to a feeling of despondency.</p>

<p>"I had my fears at the very commencement of my religious course,
that my convictions and impressions, like the morning cloud and
early dew, would soon pass away, and that I should be permitted
to relapse into my original state of darkness and indifference; yet
these fears came upon me only at times, like a sudden gust of wind
in a serene evening. Now, alas! I have to mourn over their perpetual
presence and desolating power; and I sometimes think, the
doom of a backslider, or an apostate, awaits me. I shudder in anticipation
of such a dreadful issue; and though I often pause and listen,
yet I hear not the voice of the Comforter. Yet I cannot go
back; perhaps I may say, when taking a survey of the more general
state of my heart, I move slowly onwards between hope and fear.</p>

<p>"I have lately formed an intimate friendship with two excellent
ladies, who reside with their brother, not more than a quarter of
a mile from the Elms; and in whose society I spend a considerable
portion of my leisure hours. From the influence of their example,
and from their conversation, I anticipated much spiritual improvement;
but the oftener I visit them, the deeper I am plunged in
mental despondency; and though I have ventured to allude, in
indirect terms, to the perplexed state of my mind, yet I cannot
obtain from them the words of consolation which I need. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and their brother have adopted the views of Romaine as their religious
standard; and hold his memory in such veneration, that they
rank him next to the inspired writers, and tacitly condemn all who,
on any religious points, differ from him. They have lent me his
treatises on the Life and Triumph of Faith, which I have read with
close attention; but instead of deriving from them that satisfaction
which I was led to expect, they have revived all my former fears, and
invested them with a tenfold poignancy. He says, when addressing
the believer, 'Thou must be first persuaded of thine interest in
Christ, before thou canst make use of it, and improve it; and therefore
the knowledge of thy union with him must be clear and plain,
before thou canst have a free and open communion with him.' I
might have passed over this passage, without having taken any particular
notice of it, had it not coincided with the belief which has
been so often expressed by my excellent friends, the Misses Corrie
and their brother. They say, in the most express terms, that an
assurance of our interest in Christ, and of our final salvation, is
essential to faith; but this assurance I do not possess. Sometimes
I have thought that the Saviour has looked with an eye of compassion
on me, and has raised my desponding soul to the ineffable manifestations
of his love; but I cannot say that 'he gave himself for
me.' I rely on the efficacy of his death for acceptance and eternal
life; but I dare not say that my dependence is genuine. In some
favoured moments, I have anticipated the blissful interview, when
I have hoped to see him as he is, but I cannot speak with confidence&mdash;O
no! I dare not. While my necessities compel me to go to the
Saviour, and plead his promises, my want of assurance keeps me
back; and thus, being suspended between these propelling and repulsive
powers, I suffer extreme mental torture.</p>

<p>"But this is not the only subject on which my mind is perplexed.
In a conversation the other evening, when we were tracing up the
bestowment of every good and every perfect gift to the free and
unmerited grace of God, Mr. Corrie asserted, with the utmost degree
of confidence, that no true believer in Jesus Christ can doubt his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
personal election to eternal life. This assertion, made by so good
and amiable a man, and which met the decided approbation of his
sisters, fell upon my ear with all the terror of the condemning sentence;
and from that moment to the present, I have been driven, as
an outcast, from the promises of mercy, I have read the Scriptures
to satisfy my mind on this point, and there I read of sinners being
chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world&mdash;of their being
elected according to the foreknowledge of God the Father&mdash;of their
being predestinated; but this high point appears invested with such
terror, that my spirit recoils when attempting to approach it; and
though I have prayed for faith to receive the hidden mysteries of
revelation, and for wisdom to understand them, yet I cannot believe
that I am one of the selected number, whose name has been enrolled
in the Lamb's book of life. But should I feel all this terror on my
spirit, when adverting to a doctrine which appears stated, with the
utmost degree of explicitness, by the inspired writers, if I had that
faith which is of the operation of the Spirit of God? Should I, if
I possessed like precious faith, recoil, with almost instinctive dread,
from a subject on which my pious friends speak with so much animation
and delight? Surely there must be some defect in my experience,
which renders me incapable of disengaging myself from the
bondage of fear in which I am held; and which holds me back from
a participation of that glorious liberty which I see enjoyed by the
children of God around me.</p>

<p>"There is one point of resemblance between my experience and
that of my friends, too striking to pass unnoticed; yet, when reading
the Scriptures, it has merely served to involve me in a still more perplexing
labyrinth of difficulty. It is this&mdash;they maintain 'that our
hearts undergo no moral improvement when the great renovation
takes place, but remain as impure and deceitful as before.' I certainly
did anticipate, when I first felt the influence of the truth, that
I should grow in grace as well as in knowledge; and that I should
attain to a more near conformity to the image of Jesus Christ; but
on a close and impartial examination, I am compelled to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
I have made no progress: indeed, I fear I have made a retrograde
movement. I do not feel that calm satisfaction, or any of the blissful
emotions I felt, when my attention was first arrested by the unseen
realities of eternity. I do not feel that indifference to worldly
objects, which I felt when confined to a couch of pain and languor.
I am not so deeply affected by the unparalleled love of Christ, as I
was when I first viewed him bearing away the iniquities of the
people by the agonies of his death; nor does sin appear so exceedingly
sinful, as when I first experienced its bitterness. I am neither
so grateful for my mercies, nor so abased on account of my transgressions,
as I was when the light of a supernatural manifestation
first threw open to my view my neglected obligations and concealed
defects. I feel, if possible, more fully convinced of the absolute need
of a Saviour, than I was when I first felt the burden of guilt upon
my conscience, but yet I am less able to exercise faith in him; and
instead of that peace which was diffused through my heart when I
first believed, I am sometimes driven to the verge of despondency.</p>

<p>"I have not yet communicated to my dear parents the present
perturbed state of my feelings, as I am unwilling to give one pang
of sorrow to their tender bosom; and though I sometimes pray that
the Lord would be pleased to turn away from me the face of his
anger, and comfort me, yet I cannot pray in faith. Surely no one
else ever felt what I feel, or suffered what I suffer. There are two
verses in a favourite hymn, which, I believe, was composed by the
venerable Newton, which I can repeat with intense earnestness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Lord, decide the doubtful case;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou who art thy people's Sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine upon thy work of grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If it be indeed begun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'May I love thee more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I love at all, I pray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I have not lov'd before,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Help me to begin to-day.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I am happy to inform you, that there is a Dissenting chapel about
three quarters of a mile from the Elms, in which the gospel is preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with great simplicity and power, and where my esteemed friends,
the Corries, usually attend; so that a kind Providence has made
that provision for our spiritual necessities outside the pale of the
Establishment, which we should have preferred within, but which is
denied us unless we go to a considerable distance. We have attended
this chapel regularly for some time, and are much delighted
with the minister. He is an amiable, unobtrusive man&mdash;imbued,
I trust, with the spirit of his Master&mdash;cheerful in his disposition,
but rather reserved. Those who are admitted into more familiar
intimacy, speak of him in the highest terms of affectionate respect;
and he is much esteemed by his people. You know we are
attached to the Church; but, after mature deliberation, we are satisfied
that it is our duty to hear the gospel; and as it is not preached
by our Vicar, we feel it no less a duty than a privilege to go where
the Lord has sent it. Our decision has offended some of the <em>anti-evangelical</em>
high church families, who regard the Church of England
with as much veneration as a Roman Catholic would a relic of St.
Peter; but we must obey the dictates of conscience, which will no
longer permit us to attend a ministry where the truths of the gospel
are not preached.</p>

<p>"From some of our new clergyman's discourses I have derived
consolation, but he has not touched on any of the points of perplexity
in which my mind is involved; and though at times I have
thought of soliciting a personal interview, to make known to him
all I feel, and all I fear, yet I cannot assume a sufficient degree of
confidence to do it. Indeed, I cannot speak freely on such delicate
subjects to any one but to you; and I hope, if you cannot spare time
to pay us your long promised visit, that you will favour me with
your advice, and I know you will not neglect to pray for me.</p>

<p>"My sister Emma, I regret to say, continues to manifest a decided
aversion to the things of the Spirit of God&mdash;they are foolishness to
her; but Jane is becoming much more serious. I do not think that
she is yet decided, but I hope the good work is begun. I often find
her with her Bible, and sometimes she retires to her own room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the evening, where I hope she spends some portion of her time in
praying to her Father in secret; and if so, He who seeth in secret
will ultimately reward her openly.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Louisa</span>.
</p>

<p>"To Mrs. Loader."</p></blockquote>

<p>When a young Christian searches the Scriptures for correct information
on the great questions of religion, and is favoured with the
assistance of judicious and pious friends, he usually passes on from
one degree of knowledge to another without meeting with the formidable
obstructions and perplexing embarrassments to which he is
exposed, by the conflicting opinions which are prevalent amongst us.
The light which shines on the sacred page, when it comes <em>directly</em>
from above, is clear and pure, and makes distinctly manifest, to the
judgment and the conscience, the truth as it is in Jesus, in its
simplicity and power. But when it passes through a human medium,
it often shines in an oblique course, throwing into the shade
some essential parts of the economy of Divine truth; and hence a defective
theory is sometimes embraced, which always proves unsatisfactory,
and sometimes fatal to our peace. It is therefore impossible
to exercise too much caution, in the early periods of our experience,
in the choice of our religious associates, and of the books which we
read; as it is in the power of error, whether it comes from the lips of
friendship or from the press, to do more essential injury than the
truth may be able to repair, till after a lengthened period of extreme
anxiety and disquietude. And as we are so liable to receive pernicious
impressions from the numerous errors which are in perpetual
circulation around us, we cannot depend with too much simplicity,
or docility of disposition, on the Holy Ghost, whom the Saviour has
promised to his disciples. "And I will pray the Father, and he shall
give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because
it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he
dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. He shall teach you all
things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
said unto you. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine,
and shall shew it unto you." Hence it is indispensably necessary
for the Christian, in every period of his life, but especially when
entering on his religious course, to implore the gracious influence
of the Divine Spirit, to guard him against every species of error&mdash;to
lead him into all truth&mdash;and to invest the truth with that holy
unction, which will render it no less a source of the highest intellectual
improvement, than of the most exquisite mental enjoyment.
Such a habit of dependence on Divine aid will be an effectual safeguard
against the spirit of self-sufficiency, which proves so fatal to
those who are enslaved by it; and while it will stimulate to mental
diligence in searching the Scriptures, that we may ascertain what is
the mind of the Spirit, it will keep us in a state of independence of
human opinion.</p>

<p>But while I wish to point out to the attention of the young Christian,
the dangers to which he is exposed from the society of his
pious yet injudicious friends, and to bring him into immediate connection
with the Spirit of truth, I would, at the same time, guard
him against indulging any visionary expectations respecting the
mode of His instruction, or the infallible certainty of the opinions
He may permit us to form. He teaches through the medium of the
Scriptures, even while the judgment is altogether unconscious of any
supernatural assistance; but His communications are restricted to
those points in the system of truth which are essential to salvation;
leaving us to form our own judgment on questions of minor importance.
Hence the agreement amongst the disciples of Christ, on
what is essential, and their diversity on what is non-essential.</p>

<p>But even when we are taught by the Holy Spirit, and thus imbibe
the truth in its most perfect state, it will not always retain its
original power of impression, but will admit of a partial declension
in moving the affections, even while its authority over the judgment
and the conscience remain undiminished. Hence the lines of Cowper
are often employed as expressive of the disconsolate state of the
heart:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where is the blessedness I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When first I saw the Lord?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where is the soul-refreshing view,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of Jesus and his Word?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What peaceful hours I once enjoy'd!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">How sweet their mem'ry still!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But they have left an aching void,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The world can never fill."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this cessation of a powerful excitement, which usually succeeds
the first impressions of truth, is often regarded, by the Christian,
as an indisputable evidence of the decay of his religious principles,
when it may be nothing more than a necessary consequence of
the more advanced progress of his personal experience, as the change
of the leaf, from living green to the auburn hue, is a plain indication
that the fruit is advancing in its ripening process.</p>

<p>The above account presents an instance, which has many parallels,
of the struggles, anxieties, and perplexities, which so often beset the
mind of the believer on his first entering on his career of Christian
experience. I shall return soon to the continuation of the history
of Mr. Holmes' family; but, in the meantime, must beg the courteous
reader to accompany me back, for a short space, to my own town,
from which I have been led by this digression in my narrative.</p>

<h2>THEATRICAL AMUSEMENTS.</h2>

<h3>PART I.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_192.jpg" alt="O" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">One morning, while musing on the changing scenes of
my eventful life, recalling the past, and speculating
on the future, I received a letter from an old friend,
requesting that I would call on her as soon as I could
make it convenient. From the tone of the letter, and some expressions
contained in it, I judged she was in trouble, and accordingly
proceeded immediately towards her house. As I was passing along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
I remembered that, several years before, I had received a similar
note, written by the same hand, and in a similar strain of grief.
The writer was a widow, whose husband had been cut off in the
flower of his days, leaving her to provide for their children, who
were at that time all dependent on her. On the occasion I speak
of, I found her bewailing the alarming illness of her only son, a
youth of about fifteen years. She complained with bitterness that
the Almighty, who had taken away her husband, was now about to
take away her first-born also. I attempted to bring her mind into
a state of acquiescence to the Divine will, by reminding her that no
affliction came by chance&mdash;that he who works all things after his
own counsel, often sends an early affliction, to prevent a more painful
one&mdash;and that when he is pleased to take from us our choicest
comforts, it is "for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
holiness." She replied that the Almighty might tear her son from
her, but she could not surrender him. When I expostulated with
her, she did not attempt to justify her opposition to the will of God,
but excused herself from the affection she bore her son; and earnestly
requested me to pray for him, and pray that his life might be
spared. We prayed together for the lad, and in due time he was
restored to health. Having removed soon after this to a different
quarter of the town, I had seen but little of him or his family for a
considerable time.</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps, thought I, as I drew near the house of sorrow, the life
of this son is again in danger. He has been spared a few years, as
the staff of his mother's strength, and now she is inured to her
troubles, he is about to be taken from her. Indulgent, yet mysterious
Providence! The lines of the poet recurred to my recollection
with peculiar force&mdash;</p>

<p>When I entered the room, I found her reclining on a sofa, and in
tears, her three daughters weeping apart. Though I knew not the
cause of their distress, I felt at once that some great calamity had
befallen them. My presence seemed to revive their grief, for when
they beheld me, there was a spontaneous burst of anguish. At
length, when nature had given vent to her feelings, and recovered a
portion of that strength which had been consumed by the violence of
grief, the sufferer informed me that her son had brought upon them
a deluge of sorrow. Without going into particulars, she requested
me to read the following letter, which was lying on the table:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mother</span>,&mdash;Apprehensive that you may be alarmed by
the abruptness of my departure from home, I write to inform you
that I am well; and when I reach the place of my destination, I will
send you my address. I now regret the course I have taken, but
this will not bring back my departed reputation, nor heal the wound
which I have inflicted on your peace. Had I taken your advice,
and kept myself from evil companions and vain amusements, I had
still been a virtuous and happy man&mdash;your comforter, and the support
of the family; but I disregarded your lessons, and became a
regular attender of the theatre, to the fatal attractions of which, I
am convinced, I now owe my ruin. From the theatre, it was but
one step to the tavern and the gaming table. To gratify my passion
for the latter, I embezzled my masters' property, and am now a
wretched fugitive from the pursuit of justice. Remember me very
kindly to my sisters, and tell them never to enter a theatre, for it
is to my attendance at that place of dissipation, that I attribute my
first deviation from the right path.&mdash;Your undutiful, yet affectionate
son,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">W. Harvey</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Oh! my poor William," exclaimed his mother, "oh! that I
should ever have lived to see this day! Our disgrace is all over the
town this morning. Look at this, too," she continued, producing a
hand-bill offering a reward of Â£50 for the apprehension of William
Harvey, absconded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>After perusing these, I expressed my heartfelt sympathy with
the family, and tried to soothe their feelings and offer words of
comfort; but what comfort could I impart in such circumstances!
In answer to my inquiries, I drew from her, amidst sobs and tears,
an account of her son, and the causes which had produced the fatal
transformation in his character. It was to the following effect:&mdash;At
the decease of his father, he was removed from school, and placed in
the counting-house of Messrs. &mdash;&mdash;, extensive merchants in the town.
Being a lad of strong natural powers and quick perceptions, active
and industrious in his disposition, he soon made himself very useful,
and within the space of three years, had so established himself in
the esteem and respect of his employers, as to be promoted to a post
of responsibility and trust. He was distinguished from most young
men of his age, by the soundness of his judgment, and the sobriety
of his habits, and so devotedly attached to his mother and his sisters,
that he made the promotion of their happiness his constant study.
In the morning he went to the duties of his station with cheerfulness;
and in the evening, when the toils of the day were ended, he
either retired to his own room, to read the amusing or instructive
page, or passed it away in their society. He would often admit,
when conversing with his pious mother, the necessity of personal
religion, yet he thought some distant futurity a more convenient
season for attending to it than the present time; and hence the
strong impressions which he occasionally received, when engaged
in the public exercises of devotion, were soon obliterated by the
tumultuous anxieties of commercial life. But when about the age
of eighteen, he began to feel the necessity of personal religion; and
though he did not suffer its interesting and important inquiries to
divert his attention from his secular pursuits, yet he was convinced
that it was no less his duty to be "fervent in spirit, serving the
Lord," than diligent in his business.</p>

<p>His mother witnessed this moral renovation of his character with
peculiar delight; and soon had the pleasure of hearing him lead the
devotions of the family both morning and evening. For the space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of two years, he was equally distinguished for his diligence in
business and his fervour of devotion, till at length he fell into the
company of a young man who ultimately effected his ruin. This
young man was the son of a wealthy citizen, as accomplished in
manners as he was corrupt in principles; and though he made no
profession of religion, yet he affected to treat it with great respect,
and thus more effectually gained an ascendency over young Harvey.
Their first acquaintance soon ripened into the maturity of an ardent
friendship; and notwithstanding the dissimilarity of their opinions,
they became almost inseparable companions. Each felt anxious to
gain the other over to his own course, and adopted what he conceived
to be the most likely method; but it soon became apparent, that
evil communications more speedily corrupt the virtuous, than good
communications reclaim the vicious. One of the earliest symptoms
of this corruption of principle, was his becoming an occasional frequenter
of the theatre, a place which, hitherto, the pious admonitions
of his mother had prevented him from entering. Then came
abandonment of his home, and of the society of its inmates, after
the business of the day had terminated, which broke in upon the
devotional order of the family, and often led to inquiries and remonstrances
which were natural, but painful. These gentle and
affectionate remonstrances at first had a powerful effect, and he was
induced to return to his former habits; but in process of time, they
were either heard with indifference, or resented, and he who had
officiated at the family altar, in a humble and apparently contrite
spirit, informed his mother that he should in future decline engaging
in such a responsible office. She besought him in the most urgent
and imploring manner, to rescind his avowed determination, and
once more break away from that fatal charm, which was seducing
him from the path of righteousness and peace; but she could not
succeed. He was resolute and decided; and after this time rarely
returned home till very late at night.</p>

<p>"I have sat alone," said his mother, "watching for his return, till
one, two, three, and even four in the morning; and when I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
opened the door, he more often abused me for my kindness, than apologized
for his misconduct. Having spent his midnight hours in dissipation,
he consumed those of the morning in sleep; and sometimes
did not get to business much before noon. Though he foresaw what
might be the consequences of his folly and impiety, yet no arguments
were sufficient to induce him to change his course. He grew worse
and worse, till at length he disappeared two days ago, and I heard
nothing of him till yesterday, when I received the letter which has
thrown us all into such misery. This trial, which would have been
a severe one under any circumstances, is to me peculiarly poignant;
as it brings to my remembrance my sins. It is now just seven
years since the Almighty appeared to be taking him from me, and
such was the heavenly frame of his mind, that he was not unwilling
to go. Had he died then, I should have wept over his grave, but I
should have had the prospect of meeting him in a better world. Or
if I had felt resigned to the will of God, he might have been restored
to me in mercy, as was Isaac, when the angel of the Lord forbade
his venerable father to slay the sacrifice which he had so willingly
bound, and placed on the altar; but I was rebellious. I prayed for
his life, because I thought it essential to my happiness; and his life
has been spared; but alas, he is become the destroyer of our peace.
It is now, Sir, only two years since he began to turn his attention
to religious subjects, and to lead the devotions of our family; and
though, like most parents, I rejoiced with trembling, yet hope preponderated,
and I thought he would have been my support and comfort
in my old age; but alas, the vision of bliss has disappeared, and
I am left to desolation and despair." Here she paused to weep,
and then resumed her tale of sorrow. "I watched his gradual departure
from the ways of righteousness with much anxiety, and made
many efforts to reclaim him; and though he yielded at first to my
solicitations, and made many solemn promises, yet he broke them
all, and gave himself up to the company of the wicked. <em>The stage
has been his ruin.</em> Till he entered the ill-fated theatre, which throws
out its unhallowed attractions to beguile and captivate the thoughtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and the gay, he was one of the best of sons, and one of the
kindest of brothers, fond of home, and devoted to his mercantile
duties; but after he had acquired a taste for its scenes and its performances,
he became undutiful to me, unkind to his sisters, indolent
and extravagant, unwilling to submit to the control of authority or
of reason, and determined to follow the devices and desires of his
own heart, even though he should plunge us all in ruin. It was in
the theatre that he fell into bad company&mdash;it was there he lost his
strength to resist temptation; and being once overcome, he surrendered
himself, a willing captive to the service of iniquity. Ill-fated
place! There many a virtuous youth has become the victim
of sin! and there my William fell, and in his fall he has destroyed
my happiness for life. Where he is gone, I know not, nor do I
know what destiny awaits him; but this I know, from bitter experience,
that the theatre will corrupt the most virtuous; and while it
professes to afford only amusement and instruction, it often becomes
the destroyer of personal honour and of social happiness."</p>

<p>I retired from this scene, my mind loaded with anxiety on behalf
of the unfortunate family, deeply regretting that it was not in my
power to afford them any effectual relief. I could not reclaim the
infatuated youth, nor yet repair the moral injury which the attractions
of the theatre had brought upon the honour and peace of their
household. I was grieved by their tale of sorrow; but it did not surprise
me, as I had met with too many proofs of the debasing tendency
of theatrical amusements, to be astonished by such a narrative.</p>

<p>I had an engagement to spend the evening of the day on which
the above conversation took place, at the house of a friend, who
had invited me to meet a gentleman from London, an acquaintance
of his, who was then paying him a visit. On arriving there I found
a small party assembled. In the course of the evening, after a
desultory conversation on various matters, we found ourselves involved
in a close, though not angry debate. The circumstance
which led to this spirited discussion, was a reference to a recent
verdict which had been given against a celebrated comedian, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
crime which never can be visited with too much severity, as it
tends not only to the corruption of public morals, but the destruction
of private and domestic happiness.</p>

<p>"It is of importance," said Mr. Proctor, the gentleman at whose
house we were spending the evening, "that they who lash the vices
of the age, and who hold them up to scorn and contempt, should be
virtuous themselves, or they will do more injury by their example,
than they will do good by their professional labours."</p>

<p>"Very true, Sir," replied a Mr. Talbot, one of the party, who was
a great admirer of the drama, "but we must not expect to find the
perfection of human nature in a profession which is exposed to so
many and such powerful temptations!"</p>

<p>"The perfection of human nature!" exclaimed Mr. Proctor's London
friend, Mr. Falkland, "perhaps it would be impossible to find a
class of men, in any single profession, in which we shall find so little
virtue and so much vice as in the theatrical profession."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, do you really mean to say, that the stage
never exhibits, in the private character of its performers, the beauty
and consistency of virtue? Surely you are not so uncharitable!"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I will not say that every one who appears on
the stage is immoral, in the broad acceptation of that term; but I
mean to say that the great majority are more depraved in their
tastes, habits, and conduct, than the general average of society.
This is a fact which I presume no one will attempt to deny, who
possesses an accurate knowledge of the character of the performers
at our theatres."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"There is, I admit, too much truth in what you now
say; and how will you account for it?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"To account for it is not difficult&mdash;the moral tendency
of their profession is a sufficient reason; and that we may
have the most palpable and unequivocal evidence of its nature, it is
allowed by Providence to operate in the first place and to the fullest
extent on the morals and character of the persons who are engaged
in it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"There, Sir, I am at issue with you; for I maintain
that the moral tendency of theatrical amusements is favourable to
the cultivation and growth of private and public virtue; and though
some who are touched with the puritanical spirit of the age, may
assert the contrary, yet I think they will not be able to prove it."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, if the moral tendency of theatrical
amusements be favourable to the cultivation and growth of private
and public virtue, will you be kind enough to say, how it comes to
pass that the very persons who are employed to conduct them, are,
in general, the most profligate members of society?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, they are profligate before they enter the
profession."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"But can't men of high-toned virtue be induced
to enter a profession, which is intended to promote the moral improvement
of the age&mdash;to make us wiser and better?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Very few. The majority are persons of talent, who
go '<em>through all the vagabondry of life</em>,' and then offer themselves to
the stage as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dernier</i> resort."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"They first become profligate, and then betake
themselves to the stage, as a forlorn hope!"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"They are profligate before they enter on the stage,
which is an evil every virtuous man must deplore."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"And <em>remain</em> profligate after they are on."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Too many."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"The majority, Sir."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Perhaps so."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, if the tendency of their profession be
favourable to the cultivation and growth of virtue, how is it that it
does not reclaim these profligate players? How is it that it does
not scatter the seeds of virtue among them, and raise it to a high
state of culture?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, are there not many who wear the gown
immoral?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I fear there are, Sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"And yet, I presume, you will admit, that the moral
tendency of the clerical profession and duties is favourable to the
cultivation and growth of private and public virtue."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Most certainly, Sir."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Then, how comes it to pass, if it be so, that these men
still remain immoral?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Permit me to say, that the introduction of this
question is no satisfactory reply to my argument. Answer that in
the first place, and then you are at liberty to propose what queries
you think proper. If the tendency of the theatrical profession be
favourable to the cultivation and growth of virtue, how is it that
it does not reclaim these profligate players? This is the question
under debate, and let us keep to it. We may ramble after we have
settled it."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, there are two reasons which may be
assigned&mdash;their extreme profligacy before they enter their profession;
and the numerous and powerful temptations to which they are
exposed after they have engaged in it."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, theatrical amusements will not reclaim
extreme profligacy, nor produce virtue where it is most needed?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Perhaps not."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, you require a stock of virtue to
insert your graft on, or you do not calculate on raising any good
fruit?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Exactly so, Sir."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, as men of high-toned virtue, with few
exceptions, cannot be induced to engage in the theatrical profession;
and as it is found incapable of reclaiming the profligate, we can never
expect to find a preponderance of virtue amongst the members of
that profession; and, consequently, we are reduced to the necessity
of admitting this astounding fact&mdash;the men who are employed to
chastise the vices of the age, and to cultivate its virtues, are, with
few exceptions, the most profligate in their manners!"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, will you make no allowance for men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
women who are necessarily exposed to so many temptations in the
discharge of the duties of their profession?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, what peculiar temptations to vice
ought to stand connected with the duties of a profession which is
intended to promote private and public virtue?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, you know they often appear, when on the
stage, in a rank far above the level of their condition, which may
imperceptibly induce them to cherish those habits of extravagance
in private life, for which they are so notorious. But the most fatal
temptation to which they are exposed, is the too familiar intercourse
which necessarily takes place between the actors and actresses on
the stage, which cannot be avoided, unless the most popular plays
are suppressed; and would it not betray an ignorance of human
nature, to expect that this circumstance should produce no injurious
effect on their moral character?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Certainly. You reason very properly. You have
given a faithful, just, and true account of an evil which is generally
admitted. But, in accounting for this evil, have you not made a
concession which invalidates the correctness of your general position,
that the tendency of theatrical amusements is to promote the cultivation
and growth of private and public morals?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"No, Sir, I have merely assigned the causes of that
general profligacy of manners which prevails amongst players, as a
reason why you should be more indulgent towards them; and why
you should not expect the perfection of virtue to grow in such near
contact with the most fascinating temptations."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I know full well what you intended to do, and
also what you have done. May I be permitted now, to place your
leading assertion, and your last concession, in one sentence?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Yes, provided you do it fairly."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I will attempt it. The tendency of theatrical
amusements is to promote the cultivation and growth of private
and public virtue; but the actors and actresses, who are employed
in this good work, are necessarily placed in a position which destroys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
their own virtue, and brings on amongst them a general profligacy
of manners. That is, their representation of vice and vicious characters
on the stage often leads to immoral practices in their private
conduct. Does not this prove that the tendency of their professional
duties is injurious to their own morals?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Have I not admitted it, Sir?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Yes, and proved it, at the extreme hazard of
endangering your own proposition, that the stage is favourable to
the interests of <em>private</em> virtue."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, are there not many who wear the gown,
and who make much higher pretensions to virtue than players do,
who, after they have given their public lectures on morality, will
retire and sin in secret. Now, permit me to ask, if the sanctimonious
hypocrite is not a more odious character than the profligate
player?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I regret, Sir, that you should overstep the bounds
of the question under discussion, to attack the clerical profession;
but lest you should imagine that you are occupying a position from
which no fair argument can displace you, I will for once attempt to
follow you. I admit, then, for the sake of the argument, that there
are some who make higher pretensions to private virtue than the
actors and actresses of our theatres, who, after delivering their public
lectures on morality, retire and sin in secret; but will the vices
of one class of men justify the vices of another? If some of the
clergy are corrupt, will the fact of their corruption diminish the
magnitude of the players' vices? Why you have introduced this
charge against the clergy into the discussion I cannot say, as it has
nothing to do with the question at issue, which is the necessary connection
between a player's profligacy of manners and the duties of
his profession. That is, that the very performance of his duties,
when he is engaged in promoting the morality of the public, has a
tendency to produce a corruption of his own morals. But you can
bring no such charge against the moral tendency of the clerical
duties. A clergyman is not compelled, in the discharge of his functions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to give utterance to any expressions, or to perform any actions,
which have even a remote tendency to vitiate his taste or
corrupt his morals; so that if he should turn out a bad man, you
must look for the cause of it, not, as in the case of the stage-player,
in any impure and contaminating influence of his profession, but in
the depravity of his nature. If he become immoral, he acts an inconsistent
part, offers an insult to the sentiments of the virtuous
part of mankind, and loses his place in society&mdash;as a man who is a
disgrace to his profession, whose example is in direct opposition to
the acknowledged tendency of his ministerial functions. But as a
pure moral character is not necessary to qualify a man to appear on
the stage, no one feels at liberty to charge a theatrical performer
with inconsistency, even if he should become notorious for swearing,
gaming, drunkenness, or debauchery. He may revel in these
vices, and yet appear before an audience with as much confidence of
affording them gratification by his performances as he would feel if
he were a man of the purest moral excellence. It is true, that if
publicly convicted of some flagrant offence, and held up, through the
medium of the press, as the base wretch who violates the sanctity of
friendship, the admirers of the drama will express a virtuous indignation,
and wish him to perform a sort of quarantine before he again
makes his appearance before them; yet they will never regard it as
a lasting disqualification for his professional duties."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Well, Sir, after all the attacks which you have
made on the character of theatrical performers, and the defence
which you have set up in favour of the clergy, I maintain that the
sanctimonious hypocrite who retires from the pulpit, where he has
delivered his grave moral lectures, to sin in secret, is a more pernicious
character than the most profligate player that ever disgraced
his profession. For do not the vices of the clergy shake our confidence
in the truth of religion, which you know is never done by the
vices of the stage; and is not their example, in consequence of their
more powerful influence over the public mind, more destructive to
the morals of society?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"If, Sir, your belief in the Divine origin of Christianity
is ever shaken by the vices of its professors, you give a decisive
proof that it does not rest on the legitimate evidence which
is offered in confirmation of it. Christianity claims a Divine origin,
and she adduces irrefragable arguments in confirmation of it; but
the consistent conduct of <em>all</em> her professors is not one of them. Judas
was a traitor, but his treachery did not weaken the force of evidence
which the miracles of Jesus Christ supplied in favour of his
Divine mission; and though it is very common for us to look for an
exact correspondence between the life of a Christian and the purity
of his professed faith, yet if all who profess to believe in the Christian
religion should become as licentious in their manners as the
most notorious libertines, their profligacy would not weaken the
evidences on which Christianity founds her claims to our belief.
They would be convicted of the crimes of which they are guilty;
but by what process of fair argumentation could you bring the verdict
recorded against them to disprove the divinity of a system of
religion which is supported by the evidence of prophecy, of miracle,
of testimony, its own internal purity, and its more than magic
power in the renovation and transformation of the most impure
and debased of men?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Well, perhaps I made a slight mistake by saying
that the vices of the clergy tend to shake our confidence in the divinity
of our faith. It would have been more correct to say, they
have a tendency to make us mistrustful of the integrity of the clerical
character. But will you not admit that they have a most pernicious
influence over the popular mind&mdash;more especially on young
men who are just entering into active life?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir, I readily concede that the vices of the
clergy have a more pernicious effect on the morals of society than
the vices of players, because the clerical character is held in higher
estimation, and because the clergy have free access to families who
would feel themselves degraded if a player was to be introduced
into their company. The clergy who support the dignity of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
profession, as the great majority of them do, are esteemed and respected&mdash;their
friendship is highly valued and assiduously cultivated;
but players are doomed to neglect when off the boards&mdash;they
are shunned in the ordinary intercourse of social life, and kept in a
state of exclusion, which is something like an instinctive evidence,
pervading all classes, with a few exceptions, that they must be kept
aloof from the sacred precincts of the family circle. And it is to
this sensitive abhorrence, which the virtuous part of society feels,
against any familiar intercourse with players, that we are to attribute
the comparatively trifling injury which the profligacy of their
private character does to the morals of the public; but if ever this
safeguard should be broken down&mdash;if ever the line of demarcation
which estranges us from them should be removed, and they
should have free access to our homes&mdash;allowed to associate with
our sons and daughters, they would introduce amongst us a degree
of moral corruption which no authority could check or influence
subdue."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, I have known some players introduced
into the highest intellectual circles of London and Edinburgh. Why,
it is a well-known fact, that the Kembles and Siddons, Bannister,
Young, and many others, were often guests at the mansions of some
of the most virtuous and accomplished of our nobility."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I admit, Sir, that the intellectual eminence of
a few of the profession has procured for them an admission into the
society of literary men; but a virtuous public, and even that part of
the public which admires the drama, with few exceptions, will not
receive them into its private or social friendship. And in the case
of the few exceptions into whose circles they have been received,
shall we find no husband or father who has not had occasion to rue
the day when he consented to call an actor his friend? It would be
invidious to give names, or I could, from my personal knowledge,
mention some instances of the lamentable results of intimacies with
players. Enough was brought before the public to justify the remarks
of the <cite>Times</cite>:&mdash;'The conduct of persons who appear on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
stage has never been the most irreproachable; and it may be doubted
whether such a mass of living vice, as the actors and actresses
but too generally present in their private lives, is not more injurious
to public morals than the splendid examples of virtue which they
exhibit in their theatrical characters are useful.'"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"And, Sir, has no unsuspecting family had occasion
to rue the day when they received into their friendship the ministers
of religion? Have <em>they</em> never broken down the fence that
guards the sanctity of domestic virtue? Have <em>they</em> never been publicly
convicted of crime?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Yes, Sir; but when you compare the relative
numbers of the two professions, you will be compelled to admit that
there are but very few of the clerical order who trample on the decencies
and virtues of social life, and yet continue to discharge their
ministerial functions. Only let a clergyman be suspected, and he is
shunned; but let him be convicted, and he is disrobed, and held
in abhorrence, not only by the public, but by his brethren. And
though the light and trifling spirits of the age are fond of traducing
the reputation of the ministers of religion, and often impute to them
crimes of which they are not guilty, yet I fearlessly assert that, with
rare exceptions, they are an ornament to society, and are not surpassed,
if equalled, by any order of men, for sobriety, chastity, benevolence,
and all the virtues which bless and adorn social life."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Proctor.</em>&mdash;"I very much dislike the introduction of reflections
on the clerical order into these discussions, because they are irrelevant
to the question before us, and tend to perplex and embarrass
it rather than to bring it to a fair issue. The question is simply
this, '<em>Is the moral tendency of theatrical amusements favourable to the
cultivation and growth of private and public virtue?</em>' It is admitted
that the members of the theatrical profession are, with few exceptions,
loose in principles and profligate in manners; and our friend
has attempted to prove that their profession has a tendency to make
them so. Now, I think if these amusements are favourable to the
cultivation and growth of virtue, we have a right to expect that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
persons who are employed to conduct them should exhibit in their
own character the virtues which they profess to inculcate. But they
do not. This is a fact. We never think of recommending our sons
or our daughters to go to the actors and actresses of the stage, for
models from which to mould their own character. If we knew that
they were forming an intimacy with any of them, we should forbid
it, under a full conviction that such intimacies would sink them in
the esteem of the more respectable part of society, and expose them
to the most powerful and seducing temptations. Thus far, I think,
our friend has gained his point; but the question is not yet decided.
The players may be profligate, and a close connection may be traceable
between their professional labours and the corruption of their
moral principles and habits; but notwithstanding this, <em>we</em> may derive
great advantage from their theatrical representations. 'Their
business is to recommend virtue and discountenance vice&mdash;to show
the uncertainty of human greatness, the sudden turns of fate, and
the unhappy conclusion of violence and injustice'&mdash;to expose the
folly of pride, the baseness of ingratitude, the vileness of hypocrisy,
and to prove, by an appeal to the senses, rather than by logical
reasoning, that virtue is its own reward and vice its own tormentor;
and surely, Sir," addressing himself to Mr. Falkland, "you will not
presume to say that the immorality of 'their private lives' disqualifies
<em>us</em> from receiving the moral benefit of their public labours?
This, I think, would be a position which you could not maintain."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, I maintain that the frequenters of our
theatres sustain, with rare exceptions, more moral injury from the
representations they witness on the stage, than they receive moral
benefit. Your friend Mr. Talbot admitted, in an early part of this
discussion, that familiarities of expression and action take place on
the stage which offend modesty, and if so, I appeal to you whether
such expressions and actions can produce any other effect than an
impure and demoralizing one."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Proctor.</em>&mdash;"But these offensive familiarities are not of perpetual
occurrence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"But they are of frequent occurrence; and when
they do occur they taint a pure mind and inflame a corrupt one.
The following is a just critique on our popular comedies:&mdash;'The
English comedy is like that of no other country. It is the school in
which the youth of both sexes familiarize themselves with vice,
which is never represented there as vice, but as mere gaiety.'"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Proctor.</em>&mdash;"I admit the correctness of this statement to a certain
extent; and will confess that I have at times wished my children
out of the theatre, from an apprehension of the possibility of
their sustaining some injury from what they saw and heard; yet I
still cleave to the stage, for a reason which, I think, you will not controvert."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"And what may that be?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Proctor.</em>&mdash;"The stage is a source of amusement&mdash;I may say,
of great amusement. It drives away the vapours, raises our spirits,
and gives an agreeable variety to life. I willingly overlook what is
objectionable in expression and action, for the sake of the high
gratification which a good comedy yields; and so do others. To be
candid, we think less about our virtue than our enjoyment. We
must have some sort of excitement to help us to endure the cross
purposes and the ups and downs of life."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I have no doubt but the great majority who frequent
the theatres, enjoy, even to ecstasy, the scenes which are exhibited,
and retire from the enchanting place deeply regretting that
the dull uniformity of life presents no attractions half so exciting.
They smile and laugh, and even chuckle with delight, when the intrigue
of double-dealing has ensnared its victim&mdash;when the lewd
debauchee ogles his mistress, and by some sudden spring seizes her
by surprise&mdash;when virtue is made to look ridiculous by the tenderness
of her scruples&mdash;when the doctrines and precepts of our holy
religion are caricatured by the profane witling of the stage&mdash;and
when vice, disgusting and appalling vice, speaks out its profanity,
or acts its part with the adroitness of consummate villainy. Then
it is that 'the feast of soul' is enjoyed, and the spirits which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
been exhausted by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>, or by the monotonous duties of a long
day's labour, are recruited, and the agreeable alterative of the mind
takes place. O yes, the stage amuses! It is indeed an elysium of
bliss; and if it should be closed, many would weep and sigh who
never wept or sighed over a remembrance of their sins; and deem
that life a burden which was given, not for the participation of
such polluting enjoyments, but for the nobler purpose of deriving
pure felicity from the invisible Fountain of all goodness and excellence."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Proctor.</em>&mdash;"But, my good friend, must we be always weeping
over our sins, and never allowed to partake of any pleasure but
what arises from religious pursuits?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I presume, Mr. Proctor, you will admit that we
ought sometimes to mourn over our sins; and ought <em>sometimes</em> to devote
our attention to religious pursuits, unless we reject the entire
system of revelation as a cunningly devised fable?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Proctor.</em>&mdash;"I think, Sir, I am as firm a believer in the Divine
origin of Christianity as yourself, though probably we may differ on
some high points of speculative opinion; yet I cannot perceive that
Christianity condemns the theatre, nor am I disposed to object to
its performances <em>in toto</em>, because an audience sometimes derives a
momentary gratification from scenes and expressions which a severe
moralist might condemn. I admit that the stage would derive some
benefit by being submitted to a purifying process, but I would rather
retain it as it is, with all its faults, than have it abolished."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"If, as Mr. Falkland appears to contend, the Christian
religion condemns theatrical amusements, and if, notwithstanding,
they are innocent and rational, it then follows that man was
not made for the Christian religion, although that religion was made
for man; the scandal of such an inference, and its infallible support of
scepticism, cannot but make it highly desirable to prove that the
Christian religion does <em>not</em> condemn them."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"If they are innocent! and if they are rational!
But I maintain they are not innocent; and, if viewed as they ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to be, in connection with our eternal destiny, I maintain they are
not rational. But to avoid anticipating arguments which may be
afterwards adduced, I at once challenge you to bring forward proof
from the Scriptures in favour of these corrupting amusements."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"I have no positive proof to adduce in favour of
them, as the Scriptures are entirely silent on the subject; but is
not that silence a strong presumptive evidence in their favour? Did
any of the apostles ever condemn the theatrical exhibitions of the
times in which they lived? but would they not have done it if they
thought their tendency had been at variance with the spirit and
design of that religion which they came to propagate amongst mankind?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, because they did not in their epistles,
which were addressed to the converted pagans who had renounced
their former evil customs, condemn the gladiatorial exhibitions of
Rome and of Greece, you think that a fair argument arises in favour
of them?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, if they had considered them unfavourable to
the morals of the people, they most certainly would have condemned
them."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"What if the persons to whom they wrote had
previously renounced them?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But we have no proof that the early Christians did
abstain from these sources of amusement."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"There, I think, you are mistaken. We have incontestable
evidence to prove that the early Christians not only
abstained from them, but condemned them in the most unqualified
terms of reprobation; and I will now, with your leave, read a collection
of testimonies on the subject, with which I was lately favoured
by a friend:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The Romans,' says CÃ¦cilius, the heathen, in Minutius, 'govern
and enjoy the world, while you Christians are careful and mopish,
abstaining even from lawful pleasures. You visit not shows, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
are present at the pomps; you abhor the holy games&mdash;a melancholy
ghastly people ye are.'</p>

<p>"'True,' says Octavius, 'we Christians refrain from the play-house,
because of its intolerable corruptions. We cannot be present
at the plays without great sin and shame.'</p>

<p>"Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, who flourished about the year 170,
in his book to Autolicus has these words:&mdash;'It is not lawful for us
to be present at the prizes of your gladiators, lest by this means we
should be accessories to the murders there committed. Neither
dare we presume upon the liberty of your shows, lest our senses
should be tinctured and disobliged with indecency and profaneness.
The tragical distractions of Tereus and Thyestes are nonsense to us.
We are for seeing no representations of lewdness. God forbid that
Christians, who are remarkable for modesty and reservedness&mdash;who
are obliged to discipline and trained up in virtue&mdash;God forbid, I say,
that we should dishonour our thoughts, much less our practice, with
such wickedness as this!'</p>

<p>"Tertullian, who flourished in the same century, is copious upon
this subject:&mdash;'We Christians have nothing to do with the frenzies
of the race-ground, the lewdness of the play-house, or the barbarities
of the bear-garden.'</p>

<p>"Clement Alexandrinus, who lived about the year 200, affirms
that a circus and theatre may not improperly be called the 'chair
of pestilence.'&mdash;<cite>De PÃ¦dag.</cite> lib. iii.</p>

<p>"St. Cyprian, who lived in the third century, has spoken at large
upon the stage, and after having described the diversions of the play-house,
he expostulates in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What business has a Christian at such places as these? A Christian
who has not the liberty so much as to think of an ill thing?&mdash;Why
does he entertain himself with lewd representations? Has he
a mind to discharge his modesty, that he may sin afterwards with
the more boldness? Yes: this is the consequence. By using to see
these things, he will learn to do them. Why need I mention the
levities and impertinences in comedies, or the ranting distractions of
tragedy? The folly of them is egregious, and unbecoming the gravity
of believers.</p>

<p>"'As I have often said, these foppish, these pernicious diversions
must be avoided. We must set a guard upon our senses, and keep
the sentinel always upon duty. To make vice familiar to the ear is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the way to recommend it. And since the mind of man has a natural
bent to extravagance, how is it likely to hold out under example
and invitation? If you push that which totters already, whither
will it tumble? In earnest; we must draw off our inclinations
from these vanities. A Christian has much better sights than these
to look at.'</p>

<p>"St. Cyril, who lived in the fourth century, in his Catechism for
the newly baptized, has these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You have said at your baptism, I renounce thee, O Satan; I renounce
all thy works and all thy pomps. The pomps of the devil
are the diversions of the theatre, and all other the like vanities;
from which David begs of God to be delivered: 'Turn away mine
eyes,' says he, 'that they behold not vanity.' Do not then suffer
yourself to be led away by a fondness for the entertainments of the
stage, to behold there the extravagancies of plays full of wantonness
and impurity.'"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The discussion between Mr. Talbot and Mr. Falkland was here
broken off, but shortly afterwards resumed, as follows in the next
chapter.</p>

<h2>THEATRICAL AMUSEMENTS.</h2>

<h3>PART II.</h3>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_215.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">"These quotations which you have read from the ancient
fathers," said Mr. Talbot, "merely express their
private opinion on the expediency of not attending
such scenes of amusement; but as they were not endowed
with the spirit of infallibility, their opinions may be submitted
to the ordeal of examination no less than your own."</p>
</div>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Nay, Sir; these quotations do more than express
the private opinion of the historians from whose works they are
taken; they record the fact that the primitive Christians did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
attend public places of amusement, because they knew that their
moral tendency was unfavourable to the cultivation and growth of
virtue. They also prove that the stage undergoes no moral change&mdash;indecent
and profane in the olden times, when amusing Greeks
and Romans; indecent and profane still&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper eadem</i>."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, do not the expostulations of these writers,
and the arguments which they employ against an attendance at the
theatres, lead us to the conclusion that some of the early Christians
did attend them?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"No doubt, Sir, that some of the early Christians
did attend them; but their attendance was considered as the first
step to the abandonment of their religious principles&mdash;as an act of
inconsistency, which subjected them to the censures of their brethren&mdash;an
approximation to the customs of the votaries of paganism,
which, if persisted in, was visited by an exclusion from church-fellowship.
This, I think, you must admit to be decisive of the
opinion which the pure part of the primitive Christians held respecting
the lawfulness and tendency of theatrical amusements."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, waiving the opinion of the ancient fathers,
allow me to ask you one question: If the moral tendency of such
amusements be unfavourable to private virtue, how is it that there
are no express prohibitions against them in the writings of the
apostles?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, do you believe that the apostles approved
of every practice which they did not <em>expressly</em> condemn?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, yes, Sir, and I think there is strong presumptive
evidence in favour of such an opinion. Were they not employed
to furnish us with a code of laws for the government of our conduct?
and is not that code perfect? If, then, there be no law to
condemn our attendance at such places of amusement, are we not at
liberty to believe that their silence is a tacit, though not a positive
sanction?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"If, Sir, we adopt the principle for which you are
now contending, we shall be reduced to the necessity of admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that every modification of evil, which is not expressly condemned
by the sacred writers, is actually sanctioned by them. The absurdity
of such an opinion is not more flagrant than its tendency would
prove pernicious to the welfare of society. Is the crime of gaming,
or bull-baiting, or of forgery expressly condemned by the Scriptures?
and yet, Sir, would you venture to appeal to the silence of the
Scriptures as a tacit sanction of these vices? Some of the vices to
which human nature is addicted, in every age and in every country,
are expressly condemned, while others, which spring out of local
customs, and casual temptations, are condemned only by implication.
As a proof of the correctness of this assertion, nothing is said
in Scripture against the savage custom of exposing children; nothing
against slavery; and nothing expressly against duelling. But
is not the exposing of children condemned in that charge against
the Romans that they were 'without natural affection?' Is there
not a strong censure against slavery conveyed in the command to
'do unto others as you would have them do unto you?' and against
duelling, in the general prohibition of murder contained in the sixth
commandment?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"I admit the validity of your argument, in its application
to the crimes which you have mentioned, because they are the
more refined modifications of crimes which are expressly condemned;
but permit me to say that I do not recollect any passages in the
sacred volume, which by a fair implication, really condemn theatrical
amusements."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, by your permission, I will quote a
few. 'Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of
the scornful' (Psal. i. 1). Does not this passage condemn our going
into the assemblies of the ungodly? 'But I say unto you, that
every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
in the day of judgment' (Matt. xii. 36). Are there no idle&mdash;no
profane words spoken on the stage? and if it be a crime to utter
them, can it be less than a crime to go and listen to them? 'Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
the hearers' (Eph. iv. 29). Do no corrupt communications proceed
from the mouth of players? and if it be a crime to advance them,
can it be less than a crime to receive them? 'But fornication, and
all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among
you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor
jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks'
(Eph. v. 3, 4). Are there no filthy expressions&mdash;no unhallowed jesting
on the stage? and if these vices are not to be named amongst
Christians, ought they to be sanctioned by them? 'For the time
past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,
when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings,
banquetings, and abominable idolatries: wherein they think
it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot,
speaking evil of you' (1 Pet. iv. 3, 4.) Does not the apostle, in this
passage, commend those to whom it was addressed, for having renounced
their former revellings and banquetings? and does he not
arm them against the reproaches which their exemplary conduct
would bring upon them? and can we suppose that, if the apostle
was now on earth, he would give his sanction to the practice of
some modern Christians, who are to be seen, now at church, and
anon at the theatre?&mdash;now receiving the sacrament on bended
knees, and anon kindling into rapture by the exhibitions of the
stage?&mdash;now giving utterance to the solemn words, <em>O God, the Father
of heaven, have mercy upon us miserable sinners</em>, and anon applauding
expressions and sentiments which no lips can articulate but the
lips of impurity? And, Sir, lest we should, through inadvertency,
expose ourselves to the hazard of being overcome by the force of
temptation, are we not commanded to 'abstain from all appearance
of evil?' (1 Thess. v. 22);&mdash;to have 'no fellowship with the unfruitful
works of darkness, but rather reprove them?' (Eph. v. 11). Are
not these injunctions violated by those who frequent the theatre?
Are we not taught to pray, <em>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
<em>us from evil?</em> and do we not offer a violence to our own belief, and
an insult to our Father in heaven, when we pass from the attitude
of prayer, into the place over which the evil spirit reigns in undisturbed
sovereignty, and where temptations of the most seducing
tendency abound?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, in the application of these passages of
Scripture against an attendance on theatrical amusements, you have
taken for granted that their moral tendency is injurious to the cultivation
and growth of private and public virtue, which, permit me
to say, without intending to reflect on your good sense, is a species
of logical artifice, which I did not suppose you would condescend to
employ. It is an attempt to carry a position by surprise, which you
should have approached openly&mdash;a jesuitical man&oelig;uvre to take the
question of debate by the adroitness of a sheer cunning, rather than
by fair argumentation. If, Sir, you had first proved that their
tendency on the morals of society is, what you assert it to be, injurious
and pernicious, I grant there would be a propriety in the
application of the passages of the Bible which you have made, and
the contest would soon be terminated; but, as that point has not
been proved, and as I now challenge you to the proof of it, allow me
to say that your reasoning has produced no effect."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"You are at perfect liberty to examine any arguments
which I may adduce against theatrical amusements with the
utmost degree of severity, and to employ what terms you please
when expressing your opinion of their character, or of their effect;
but, Sir, you cannot expect that I shall submit to your descriptions
if I think them unjust. You accuse me of taking for granted what
remains to be proved, which, you say, is not only unfair but useless.
But I appeal to your candour if I took more for granted than what
was tacitly admitted in proof, if not actually recorded. Has it not
been admitted, that expressions are sometimes uttered on the stage
which the lips of virgin modesty could not utter? If so, will you
presume to say, that the quotation which I made does not condemn
them&mdash;'But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment?' Has
it not been admitted, that expressions are uttered, and some actions
are performed in the theatre, which have a tendency to corrupt the
minds of the actors and actresses? and if so, will you say that the
injunction which commands us <em>to abstain from even the appearance
of evil</em>, does not prohibit our witnessing such actions or listening to
such expressions? If this be not proof against theatrical amusements,
what will you call proof? If this argument does not fairly
apply, it is not because it has not strength to strike, but because you
are endeavouring to raise the dust, that you may bear off your
colours to prevent them being taken. But that you may not shout
victory on your retreat, nor taunt me with unfair dealing when you
are going down, I will consent to clear the space, and meet you on
the question of the obvious and direct influence of the stage on
the morals of society."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"I grant, Sir, that the Bible censures all indecent
and profane expressions, and that it points the severity of its rebuke
against every action which has a demoralizing tendency either on
the mind of the performer or the spectator; but I presume you will
not take upon yourself to say, that our best and most popular comedies
come under this sentence of condemnation? There are two
questions, I apprehend, which have an immediate claim on our attention&mdash;first,
What is the design of comedy? and, secondly, Will the
desired result be attained through its instrumentality? In reply to
the first question, I will quote the language of the celebrated Dr.
Blair:&mdash;'Comedy proposes for its object, neither the great sufferings
nor the great crimes of men: but their follies and slighter vices&mdash;those
parts of their character which raise in beholders a sense of
impropriety, which expose them to be censured and laughed at by
others, or which render them troublesome in civil society.' And I
doubt not, but with all your rancour against the amusements of the
theatre, you will agree with him in the following opinion which he
pronounces on the tendency of such a mode of attack:&mdash;'This general
idea of comedy, as a satirical exhibition of the improprieties and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
follies of mankind, is an idea very moral and useful. There is
nothing in the nature, or general plan of this kind of composition
that renders it liable to censure. To polish the manners of men, to
promote attention to the proper decorum of social behaviour, and
above all, to render vice ridiculous, is doing a real service to mankind.'
This is the design which comedy proposes to accomplish;
and now, Sir, we will, if you please, pass on to the consideration of
the second question, Will the desired result be attained through its
instrumentality? By the exhibition of folly and vice, in the persons
of the actors and actresses, who are held up to ridicule and censure,
a moral effect is produced on the audience, who retire from such a
scene, where the absurdities of the human character have been
exhibited to their view, infinitely more disgusted by them, than they
ever felt when listening to the grave lecture of censure or condemnation
from the pulpit. And I think, Sir, you will admit that the
worthy doctor has given us a proof of the correctness of his judgment,
when he said, that, 'Many vices might be more successfully
exploded by employing ridicule against them, than by serious attacks
and arguments.' And though, Sir, I have too much reverence for
the pulpit to treat it with contempt, and form too high an estimate
of its moral utility in correcting the disorders of society, to run it
down, yet I doubt whether it <em>can</em> wield such a keen and powerful
weapon against the folly and vices of the times, as the well-regulated
and well-conducted stage."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Your last remark, Sir, savours so much of infidelity,
that it is both offensive to my taste, and repugnant to my
understanding; and though it does not affect the question at
issue, yet I cannot let it pass without replying to it. The pulpit,
Sir, when it is the oracle of truth, is denominated the <em>power of
God</em>&mdash;that moral instrument which he uses to renew and sanctify
our corrupt nature; and on which he has conferred the singular
honour of employing it as the means of subverting the idolatry of
ancient and modern times, and of reclaiming many thousands of
the children of disobedience to the wisdom of the just; but has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
he ever identified himself with the stage? has he ever employed
the stage to turn men from darkness to light&mdash;from the power of
Satan to himself? O no! Did the stage ever recover Greece or
Rome from their licentious and barbarous rites and ceremonies?
It found them corrupt, and corrupt it left them. And what has it
done for modern Paris, where it exists in the plenitude of its glory?
There you have a proof of the weakness of its strength to reform
a people, and of the charm of its power to corrupt them. Indeed,
Sir, it requires a high degree of moral corruption as the basis of
its exhibitions, for it will be found that its performers, and its
admirers, are alike strangers to that elevated moral purity, which
brings the human spirit to some degree of resemblance to the immaculate
sanctity of the Divine nature. Hence, while many who profess
and call themselves Christians, rank amongst its advocates and
its friends, it is a fact too notorious to be concealed, that they who
are a <em>peculiar people</em>, and whose moral peculiarities are those which
the Scriptures hold out as the distinctive evidences of the Christian
character, shun it, as the habitation of evil, from whence they are
excluded no less by the force of principle than by the voice of
authority. A real Christian in a theatre, animated and delighted
with the scenes which he must behold, and with the sentiments and
expressions which he must hear, would be as great a phenomenon as
a stage player weeping at church when confessing his sins, or overpowered
with gratitude when receiving, on his knees, the sacramental
memorials of the Saviour's death."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"I was not aware, Sir, that the accidental expression
of an opinion, which has no bearing on the question at issue, would
have called forth such a spontaneous burst of disapprobation;
and though it would not be very difficult to turn back some of your
pointed interrogations to your own annoyance, yet as that would
probably consume too much of our time, we will, if you please, confine
our remarks in future to the subject under discussion. To
my questions, Sir, if you please."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Well, Sir, then to the first question. You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
given such a very flattering description of the <em>design</em> of comedy,
that you remind me of a certain painter who engaged to draw a
likeness that should represent a whole fraternity, but when he produced
it, it was found to resemble no one, having been sketched
from fancy rather than real life. I admit that a comic writer, of rare
and extraordinary powers, could get up a piece that would keep in
view, through the whole of its plot, the censure and reprobation of
the follies and vices of mankind; but have the writers of English
comedy done this? Did not the author from whom you have made
your quotations speak the truth when he said, '<em>that the English
comedy has been too often the school of vice</em>?' And is it not so? Do
not the most popular plays that are acted on the English stage
exhibit such scenes as must compel virtue, if present, to hide her
blushing face, and wish herself away? Do they not give utterance
to sentiments and expressions, which, to say the least, border on
profanity and blasphemy, and which, if admired or approved of,
must contaminate and defile?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, I hope in the ardour of your zeal against
the stage, you will not overlook the distinction which the wisest
and best of men have made between the use and the <em>abuse of a thing</em>.
I grant that certain abuses, at various periods of its history, have
disgraced this department of the drama; but what then? is it an
argument against the thing itself, any more than the impositions
of priestcraft are arguments against the value of true religion? I
grant you that the most obscene and licentious compositions have
disgraced the stage, but is the abuse of a thing any objection against
its use? Licentious writers of the comic class, as Dr. Blair very
justly remarks, have too often had it in their power to cast a ridicule
upon characters and subjects which did not deserve it; but
this is a fault not owing to the nature of comedy, but to the genius
and turn of the writers of it."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"It happens unfortunately, however, for your
side of the question, that its <em>abuse</em> has hitherto been almost the
universal characteristic of comedy, while its <em>use</em> has scarcely ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
been exemplified. Indeed, I defy any one who has a regard for
propriety to go to a theatre without hearing something to shock his
moral feelings."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, you are aware that no play can be acted
on the English stage unless it is licensed by the lord-chamberlain,
fourteen days before it makes its appearance in public; and do you
not know that he is invested with full power to prohibit the representation
of any play, if he thinks it militates against the interests
of virtue?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, if I understand you, it is lawful to introduce
any play on the stage which the lord-chamberlain licenses?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Exactly so, Sir."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Indeed! is not this rather singular! But if a
licentious play should pass through the chamberlain's office without
being detected, and come to be represented on the stage, what
would be its reception? Are you quite sure that it would be hissed
off by a British audience?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Nothing, Sir, can be a stronger proof of the respect
which a British theatrical audience feels for pure virtue, than
the well-known opposition made to the re-appearance of K&mdash;&mdash;, after
his disgraceful conduct."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"That determined opposition on the part of the
more respectable public was very gratifying; but yet I am decidedly
of opinion, that if he had absented himself for a few months,
or weeks, till the public feeling had somewhat subsided, he would
have met with a cordial reception on his re-appearance on the
stage. But he was precipitate, he did not dream that there could
be much more virtue before the scenes than behind; in this, so
far happily, he was mistaken. He forgot that many who will
connive at the vices of the stage while they remain in comparative
obscurity, or are only whispered abroad in private circles, dare not,
out of respect to the decent little observances to which they are
attached, connive at them when they are sent out of a court of
justice with a badge of indelible infamy hanging about their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
necks. His precipitancy was the cause of his rejection, rather than
his crime; for even his greatest opponents promised him their support,
if he would refrain, only for a fortnight, from appearing on
the boards, in deference to the taste and voice of the public."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Well, Sir, after the public had expressed their disapprobation
of his disgraceful conduct, and compelled him to perform
a theatrical penance, did you expect them to force him off the stage
for ever?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"No, Sir, I did not expect it. I know them too
well. The vices of the players will never be the means of excluding
them from the stage, if they possess the talent of pleasing the admirers
of the drama. These are a humane people whose mantle of
charity is so broad, that it will easily cover a multitude of sins; and
though some of them, when goaded by the severe invectives of the
press, will raise their indignant voice against the bold transgressor
who passes at once from a court of justice, where his delinquencies
have been exhibited in all their enormity, to the stage, the so-styled
school of morals, yet the lapse of a short interval will soon induce
an oblivion of his offences, and the charms of his acting will soon
re-establish him in the favour of the public. But I must now return
to the question under consideration. It is not, What will a
theatrical audience do, when an actor is convicted in a court of
justice of one of the worst of crimes that can be committed against
the sanctity of domestic honour and happiness? but, What is such
an audience <em>accustomed to do</em>, when a lewd or profane comedy&mdash;a
comedy which is the abuse of the thing&mdash;a comedy which is the
school of vice&mdash;is brought on the stage, and acted in their presence?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, I presume you know that the public often
reject plays?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Yes, when they are not to their liking."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Well, Sir, then the point is decided."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Nay, good Sir, not till you have proved that
their lewdness, their profanity, and their demoralizing tendency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
was the cause of their being rejected. Prove that, and you have
gained your point, and redeemed the audience from the heavy charge
which I bring against it, of having uniformly given the least degree
of support to the purest plays, and the greatest degree of support to
the most objectionable. When the writers of comedy mix up with
their plots incidents which we could not tolerate in virtuous life,
and introduce characters in their scenes which we should shun as the
corrupters of our manners, and do this to excite ridicule and contempt
against the religion of our country by holding pious people
up to obloquy, the audience have uniformly exclaimed, 'Ah, ah, so
we would have it! This is to our taste!' The play is again and
again called for. What you call the abuse of the thing, has been,
and still is, more popular than the thing existing in what you call
its purity. How will you account for this, unless you admit that the
taste of the audience is formed from the character of their amusements,
which tend to deprave and vitiate it?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, I admit that many who attend our
theatres are persons of dubious virtue; yet, formerly a great play-goer,
I can flatly contradict this imputed propensity on the part of
the public to applaud a licentious play. I have always heard noble
sentiments echoed in public applause, and, on several occasions, the
lurking remains of the old broad comedy received with marked disapprobation.
And whatever be the opinion of those who do <em>not</em> go
to the theatre, these facts will be corroborated by all who <em>do</em>."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"You say that all who go to plays corroborate
the facts that noble sentiments are always applauded, and obscene
expressions are marked with disapprobation. Now, Sir, I can flatly
contradict this assertion, though not from personal observation, yet
from undoubted testimony. I grant that fine passages, delivered
in an eloquent style, and which breathe the noble sentiments of
patriotism, and valour, and benevolence, and indignation against
some <em>unpopular vice</em>, are heard with pleasure; but the self-same
audience, which makes the house ring with its acclamations on these
occasions, not only silently sanctions but likewise loudly applauds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
profanity and indecency at other times. If this be not the case, how
is it that the plays, which are the school of vice, still appear on the
stage, and still retain their hold on popular favour?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"What plays do you refer to?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Why, Sir, <em>The Hypocrite</em> is one."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"<em>The Hypocrite!</em> What! do you object to <em>The
Hypocrite</em>?&mdash;A comedy which was applauded by royalty, and in
which a striking example is afforded of the attempt of fanaticism to
undermine the principles and well-being of society for its own individual
advantage, under the specious garb of religion! Surely,
you must be a very fastidious person indeed, to find anything objectionable
in that most excellent comedy! I can hardly think you
are serious."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"The design of that comedy is to hold up personal
piety to ridicule and contempt, by associating it with the weakness
of the intellect, the vulgarity of unpolished manners, and the vices
of the human character; and though the writer makes an effort at
the conclusion to redeem it from such an imputation, yet such is its
obvious tendency, and such is the effect which it is known to produce
on an audience. But as I wish to shape my objections into a
tangible form, allow me to say that the introduction and exposure
on the stage of any person making pretensions to elevated piety is,
of itself, an objectionable feature, and more calculated to excite prejudice
against all professions of religion, than to induce the hypocrite
to throw off the mask. Is this favourable to the cultivation and
growth of virtue? It may be of the virtue of a theatrical audience,
which reaches not the maturity of its growth till it has acquired
the art of caricaturing righteousness, after it has been accustomed
to make a mock of sin; but it is destructive of that pure religion
which teaches us to avoid all 'foolish talking and filthy jesting;' and
to correct our personal imperfections, instead of making sport with
the vices of others. I have read this disgusting comedy, and I do
not hesitate to say, that its indecent allusions and profane language,
are enough to corrupt any mind; and that the woman who can retire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
from the theatre after the curtain drops with a desire to see it
performed again, must have lost all that refined delicacy of feeling
which forms the greatest ornament of her sex."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Stop, Sir! I cannot allow this libel to be pronounced,
without entering my protest against it."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"No, Sir, it is not a libel. The allusions, the
language, and some of the actions of that play, are more becoming
a house of ill-fame than the school of virtue, as you wish me to
believe the play-house is; and I am conscious that no decent persons,
in any rank of life, would tolerate such allusions or actions in their
families. Allow me to ask one question, What opinion would you
form of a female who would consent to read that comedy in the presence
of an indiscriminate assemblage of young people?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Of course, Sir, I should not solicit her to do it."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"But suppose she was solicited to do it, and suppose
she did it without faltering and without blushing, what opinion
would you form of her modesty, or of the tone of her mind? Would
you like that female to be either your mother, your wife, your sister,
or your daughter?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Perhaps not."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"So I presume; for, as the poet says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Immodest words admit of no defence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For want of decency is want of sense.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">If, then, you would not like to hear a female read that play in a
private party, especially if that female was your own daughter, how
can you attempt to justify your conduct in wishing her to go and see
it performed?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Why, there is a little difference between the two
cases."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Yes, I grant there is a little difference between
the circumstances of the two cases; but, Sir, I appeal to your candour
and to your judgment, whether that comedy, when acted on
the stage, can promote the growth of virtue, which would have a
demoralizing effect if read in a private circle?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"In a theatre, each one is lost in the mass of the
audience, and hence no immediate effect is produced."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then, Sir, how can the stage, when it exists in
its purity, promote the growth of virtue, and how, when it is abused,
does it become the school of vice, if no immediate effect is produced
by the sentiments and actions which are there delivered and performed?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"I mean, Sir, that a female does not sustain that injury
in the opinion of others, who goes to see this comedy performed,
which she would, if she read it to a promiscuous assembly."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"I grant it, Sir; but will her imagination sustain
no injury by the polluting impressions which it will receive? Will
her moral taste sustain no injury by the obscene sentiments and
allusions which she will hear? Will she retire as pure from all corrupt
associations, as she was when she first entered the theatre?
Will her memory carry away no expression which you would rather
she would forget?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"But, Sir, when people become familiar with the
stage, none of these evil effects are ever felt, which you imagine
must be the consequence of their attendance."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"They may not be felt so forcibly as at first, because
by habit the taste becomes reconciled to them, which proves that
the stage lowers the high tone of virtue, and brings it down so softly
and so imperceptibly on a level with impurity, that eventually its
more disgusting forms and expressions merely excite the passing
smile or the burst of laughter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Vice is a monster of such frightful mien,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We first endure, then pity, then embrace.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"It is no use, Sir, to argue against facts. I have
gone to the theatre without being injured by it; and I have known
many of my friends who have never been injured by it."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"It may be so; but would you like a son or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
daughter to acquire a passion for theatrical amusements? And
would you suffer them, if they had acquired it, to go alone?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"No, Sir, I should not like my children to become
<em>passionately</em> fond of the theatre, though I should not object to their
occasional attendance, yet I would not suffer them to go alone."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Not like them to become passionately fond of
an amusement, which is intended and calculated to promote the
growth of their virtues! Surely, good Sir, you don't wish their
virtues to be stunted for want of nutriment; and though I can
easily conceive that the expense attending this source of gratification
and moral improvement, may form one formidable objection against
its repeated indulgence, yet, can money be better laid out, than on
the cultivation of our children's virtuous principles and habits?
Suppose, for example, you have a son who is somewhat inclined to
an evil course&mdash;one, over whose mind the grave lectures of morality
which the clergy deliver have lost their influence&mdash;who is rather
prone to treat parental authority with contempt; would you not
wish to see him cherish a passion for theatrical exhibitions, which,
according to the opinion of Mr. Proctor, and in which opinion you
concur, are designed and adapted to recommend virtue and discountenance
vice; and thus prove, by an appeal to the senses, rather
than by a process of reasoning, that virtue is its own reward, and
vice its own tormentor? If he should feel no deep interest in these
exhibitions, it is not likely that they will produce any more powerful
effect on his mind, than the grave lectures of morality which he
instinctively abhors; but if his passions are strongly excited, and he
returns to this school of wisdom and of virtue, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">con amore</i>&mdash;if he cannot
refrain from going, without doing violence to his feelings&mdash;if he
long for the hour of evening dress, and for the agreeable alterative
of mind, which is to divert him from the dull, monotonous duties of
his station&mdash;if he enter into the spirit of the comedy, which usually
makes a libertine the most attractive character in the piece&mdash;or if
the spirit of that character enters into him&mdash;do you not suppose
that he will soon be reclaimed from vice, and be so smitten with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the charms of virtue, as to follow her through evil and through good
report? And suppose several such young men should meet in the
lobby of a theatre, which you know, Sir, is not impossible; and
suppose they should sit together during the play, and should retire
together, after the curtain falls, and the last charms of the
comic muse have passed from the eye and the ear, do you not
think that they will very naturally begin to resolve on amending
their evil course, and as naturally resolve to become chaste, and
temperate, and domesticated in their habits? Of course you cannot
for a moment imagine that they will retire from this school of virtue
to the tavern or the brothel! No, Sir! The comic muse would
stand in their way, and dispute their passage, even if they should
have a secret predilection for such haunts; as a dumb ass once reproved
the madness of a certain prophet, on whose mind no other
agent of persuasion could operate!"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"Satire is no argument, Sir."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"But it often puts forth a biting one, from under
the folds of its concealment; yet, as you seem to dislike it, I will
dismiss it, and return to the more grave form of debate. Permit
me, then, to ask you, if the company into which the young are introduced
at a theatre, does not form a very powerful objection
against it?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"This is an objection against theatrical amusements,
which I have been expecting to make its appearance for some time;
and now it is out, I am not unwilling to meet it. I will then confess,
'that the English box lobbies are too much disgraced by the
open display of female prostitution,' and that too many of the baser
sort of our own sex frequent the theatre; yet, as the wisest and the
best are always to be found in attendance on the comic muse, we
may very easily keep with them, and thus avoid that contagion of
evil, to which you imagine we are necessarily exposed. We know
that vice, like every other marketable commodity, will be offered for
sale in all great public assemblages. But, Sir, can you see the vast
majority of an audience rivetted on the scenic representation, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
confessing that many a youthful passion is preserved from the
<em>out-of-doors</em> temptation to vice, by this intellectual occupation of his
time within? London, and all large towns, are, by reason of their
congregated numbers, hotbeds of vice; you know licentiousness
would find other haunts, and not be one whit limited by the suppression
of the theatre; it would be hard, indeed, that virtue should
imprison itself, because vice frequented the same resort; on that
principle we might not walk the great streets of the metropolis, in
broad day light, because of the 'polluted' neighbours on all sides."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Then you admit that the theatre is one of the
haunts of vice; and yet you say that the wisest and the best are
always to be found in attendance there, <em>and from choice</em>! How odd,
that the wisest and the best of our wise and good men and women,
young and old, should choose to go where the most profligate and
licentious resort! Surely, you will not adduce their conduct on this
point, as a conclusive argument in favour of their superior wisdom,
or their superior love of virtue! You say, if we go, we may keep
with them! But, how shall we know the wisest and the best from
the most depraved, in such a promiscuous throng as usually crowd
a theatre?&mdash;From instinct? or from some secret sign which, like
that of the Masonic order, is concealed from every one but the
initiated?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"When I go to the theatre, if I go alone, I keep
apart from others; and if I go in company, I keep with them; so
that I have no intercourse with the general audience."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Very possibly; but do all who attend the theatre
adopt the same judicious maxim?"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"They may if they choose, and if they do not, they
alone are to blame."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"Yes, they may! but do they? No, Sir, they do
not! Is it not there that the evil spirits of impurity spread their
nets for thoughtless and unsuspecting youth? Is it not there that
he often picks up an acquaintance, who leads him, after the play is
concluded, to the tavern&mdash;to the gaming-table&mdash;and to the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
ill-fame? Is it not there, that the profligate female practises her
arts of seduction,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that he learns a profane language, and familiarizes
himself with vice in its most disgusting forms? Is it not to this
school of virtue&mdash;to this resort of the wisest and the best&mdash;to this
elysium of bliss&mdash;to this paradise of excellence&mdash;that many of the
young of both sexes have ascribed their ruin? Wonder, O ye
heavens, and give ear, O earth! The school of virtue teaching vice!&mdash;the
resort of the wisest and the best the haunt of the most licentious!&mdash;the
elysium of bliss the common receptacle of outcast misery!&mdash;where
iniquity reigns, as in the high place of its dominion, and on
which thousands look in all the bitterness of anguish, as the spot
where they fell from their original purity and honour to degradation
and crime!"</p>

<p><em>Mr. Talbot.</em>&mdash;"You can paint, Sir."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"But not the theatre as it is. That's impossible.
I cannot describe the evils, the contaminating evils, to which a
young person is exposed who visits this haunt of vice&mdash;this dwelling-place
of sin&mdash;this temple of lewdness, of whose priests and
priestesses 'it is a shame even to speak of those things which are
done of them in secret'&mdash;this Augean stable of infamy, which no waters
have ever been able to cleanse. You say, that while the youth
is within the theatre he is preserved from the temptations which are
out of doors&mdash;a truism no one will doubt; and so he is, when in a
gaming-room, and so he is when in a tavern; but, Sir, is he not,
when coming away from the theatre, exposed to the out-door temptations,
and very often prepared, by what he sees and hears, to yield
more easily to them. The following fact, which is too well attested
to be denied, lets us into the awful secret of the tendency of theatrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
exhibitions; and if it were necessary, I could adduce many instances
of the most promising young men, and of the most amiable
females, who, by frequenting a theatre, have lost their character;
blasted their prospects of happiness for life, and brought down the
gray hairs of their parents with sorrow to the grave:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The robberies committed daily in the streets, during the representation
of the <em>Beggar's Opera</em>, were beyond the example of former
times; and several thieves and robbers confessed in Newgate, that
they raised their courage in the playhouse by the songs of their
hero, Macheath, before they sallied forth on their desperate nocturnal
exploits. So notorious were the evil consequences of its frequent
representation become, that the Middlesex justices united with Sir
John Fielding in requesting Mr. Garrick to desist from performing
it, as they were of opinion that it was never represented on the stage,
without creating an additional number of real thieves.' Thus we
see the debt of gratitude which the morality of the public soon contracted
with this agent of its reformation, who, for sixty-three nights
in succession, during the first season of his labours, delivered his
maxims of wisdom, and his lessons of virtue, which, by some peculiar
fatality, became the means of corrupting the audience to a most
alarming extent; but to hold the stage responsible for this, would
be, of course, a breach of the law of charity! 'The second season of
this opera was as productive as the first; nor were the provincial
stages without their gleanings from the poet's harvest; it was acted
fifty nights at Bath and Bristol. Not only Ireland, Wales, and Scotland,
but Minorca, and other distant regions, saw it in their theatres;
while its songs were everywhere to be read on fans, handkerchiefs,
and fire-screens.' Wherever this thief-maker went, he was received
with raptures by the admirers of the drama; they sung his praises
and gave him the homage of their affection as the idol god of their
theatrical adorations, and he had, like ancient Moloch, the high gratification
of seeing many of his devoted worshippers doomed to an
untimely destruction. And yet, Sir, with such facts staring you in
the face&mdash;with such confessions of convicted guilt&mdash;you have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
temerity to maintain that the theatre is favourable to the cultivation
and the growth of public and private virtue! Can you hope to
gain proselytes to your opinion? Do you imagine that we are to be
duped into the admission of an assertion which no argument can
support, which recorded facts so unequivocally disprove, and which
the worst men, in common with the best, reject as an insult offered
to the obvious dictates of their understanding? Do you suppose
that we have reached the dotage of our existence, when the intellect,
paralyzed by some extraordinary visitation of Heaven, or worn out
by the intensity of its own labours, is to sit down at the feet of
absurdity, to receive the monstrous extravagancies of convicted
falsehood as the lucid and resistless enunciations of oracular truth?
No, Sir. A general belief is gone abroad, and it exists no less firmly
amongst many of the admirers of the drama, than amongst its most
determined opponents, that while the stage may be vindicated as a
source of amusement, an attempt to vindicate it as the handmaid of
virtue is no less disreputable to the understanding, than it is to the
moral taste of the advocate, who, however dexterous he may be in
his pleadings, labours under the disadvantage of appearing in court,
after the judges have taken the verdict of an honest jury."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Proctor.</em>&mdash;"I am now, Sir, decidedly of your opinion on this
point; though I must confess I have often enjoyed a good play.
The stage, in its present state, amuses many, and gratifies their taste,
but it certainly does defile the imagination, and too often pollutes
the heart; and where one young person receives any moral good,
very many, I do believe, are corrupted and ruined. It may be
defended as a source of amusement, but it is no handmaid of virtue;
it is a very demon in the art of seduction. I had many qualms of
conscience, when I did go to the theatre; but it is now more than
two years since I entered one, and I must confess, that the present
discussions have satisfied me, that I have acted a wise and a safe
part by abstaining from going; nor will I ever go again, or allow
any child of mine to go. In fact, I think it would be a public good,
to shut up all the theatres in the country."</p>

<p><em>Mr. Falkland.</em>&mdash;"My respected friend, I assure you, I am highly
gratified to hear from your lips, such a candid confession and such
a noble resolve; and I think my formal antagonist in these discussions,
on cool reflection, will admit, that a passion for theatrical
amusements had better be repressed than encouraged; as it is always
hazardous, and sometimes fatal, especially to the young and incautious."</p>

<h2>UNITARIANISM RENOUNCED.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_236.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The power of early impressions and education is universally
admitted; and when erroneous views have
been imbibed from infancy, and become associated
with everything that is hallowed in our domestic recollections,
the influence exercised by them on the mind is so strong
as very generally to maintain undisputed authority throughout life.
Truth will sometimes, however, assert her supremacy, and succeed
in producing conviction, even where she has to contend with the
most deep-rooted feelings and long-cherished prejudices. These
remarks are suggested by the history of Mr. Macfarlane, an intelligent
and pious young man, whom I met at the house of Mr. Proctor,
on the occasion of the discussion narrated in the foregoing
chapters. I had frequently heard of him from a friend, of whose
church he was a member, and been led to take a great interest in
him from the account which had been given me of his religious history
and that of his sister. This I shall now proceed to narrate, as
exhibiting the progress, from the frigid zone of Unitarianism, to the
warmth and sunshine of pure evangelical religion.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Macfarlane's father was a wealthy merchant in the town
where I resided, universally esteemed for his amiable character and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
unsullied integrity. Descended from ancestors who had borne a
distinguished part in the struggles for civil and religious liberty
during the seventeenth century, he was himself the son of pious
parents, but their death, within a short period of each other, while
he was but a child, deprived him of the advantages which he might
have derived from their example and instructions. Left to the care
of a maternal uncle, whose sentiments were of no decided order, he
grew up to manhood with no one to guide him in his religious belief;
and having, on his first entering into business, formed an intimacy
with some zealous Unitarians, he imbibed their opinions, and
regularly attended the ministry of one of their most celebrated
preachers. He was too eager in the pursuit of wealth to devote
much time to speculative inquiries, and of too retiring a disposition
to take any part in discussion when theological topics became
the subject of conversation; but he cheerfully and conscientiously
supported the benevolent institutions connected with his denomination,
which he thought the most enlightened and intelligent in
the kingdom. While he admitted the truth of the Christian religion,
he thought its records so ambiguous, or so corrupted in
the early ages, that they ought not to be implicitly received. "I
will believe nothing," he often used to say, "which I cannot fully
comprehend; and I feel myself as much at liberty to dispute the
opinion of an apostle, when he speaks on any speculative doctrine,
as I do to examine the opinion of any other man." He rejected the
divinity of Jesus Christ as indignantly as a Christian would the
divinity of the pagan deities&mdash;often expressed his surprise that any
enlightened man could be brought to believe in the doctrine of the
atonement&mdash;and regarded the belief in the reality of a supernatural
influence over the human mind, as one of the corruptions of Christianity,
which exposed it to the ridicule and contempt of infidels.</p>

<p>But though a decided Unitarian, he did not condemn those who
differed from him, believing that the Supreme Being is altogether
regardless of our speculative opinions, if we do justice, love mercy,
and walk humbly with him. "If we are virtuous in this life we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
shall be happy in the life to come,"&mdash;was with him a favourite saying.
He was the living personification of the social virtues; and
justly esteemed for his kindness, his generosity, his integrity, and
universal benevolence. Mr. Macfarlane, Senior, was a widower,
with two children, a son and daughter, who, at the time I speak of,
were between twenty and thirty years of age. The son was in
business with his father, and the daughter managed the household
affairs. Miss Macfarlane was a young lady of amiable temper, retired
in her habits, fond of reading, and devoted to the promotion
of the happiness and comfort of her father and brother. As she
had a good deal of leisure at her disposal, she was employed as the
almoner of her father's bounty; and took much pleasure in this
work of mercy.</p>

<p>She was somewhat religiously inclined; but as the system of religion
under which she was educated possessed no power to interest
the heart, her religion was confined to a cold assent to a few speculative
opinions, and the observance of some external ceremonies.
She occasionally read the Bible, but from her religious training she
yielded no submission to its authority; and, as a natural consequence,
she was strongly prejudiced against the evangelical sentiments
of orthodox Christians. Though she had several friends
belonging to their number, and among others Miss Reynolds, a
young lady of decided piety, yet even with her, notwithstanding
their great intimacy, she invariably declined to enter into conversation
on the subject. She usually accompanied her father and her
brother on the Sabbath to the Unitarian chapel, where the celebrated
Dr. R&mdash;&mdash; preached, to whose ministry they were all much
attached. On one occasion he delivered a discourse from the beautiful
words of the psalmist:&mdash;"Thou wilt shew me the path of
life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are
pleasures for evermore" (Psalm xvi. 11). After an eloquent dissertation
on the nature of the Deity, and the assistance afforded
by Him to those following the arduous path of virtue, he concluded
thus:&mdash;"Supposing the ideas which I have set before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to be no more than the speculations of a contemplative mind, such
as were wont of old to be indulged by the philosophers of the Platonic
school, still they would deserve attention, on account of their
tendency to purify and elevate the mind. But when they are considered
in connection with a revelation which we believe to be
Divine, they are entitled to command, not attention only, but reverence
and faith. They present to us such high expectations as are
sufficient to determine every reasonable man to the choice of virtue,
to support him under all his present discouragements, and to comfort
him in the hour of death. Justly may they excite in our hearts
that ardent aspiration of the psalmist:&mdash;'My soul thirsteth for God,
for the living God; O! when shall I come, and appear before him?'
But with this wish in our hearts, never, I beseech you, let us forget
what was set forth in the first part of this discourse;&mdash;that in order
to arrive at the presence of God, <em>the path of life</em> must previously be
shown to us by him, and that in this path we must persevere to the
end. These two things cannot be disjoined&mdash;a virtuous life and a
happy eternity."</p>

<p>As they were conversing together in the evening of the Sabbath,
a reference was made to this discourse, when young Macfarlane
expressed the high degree of pleasure which it had given him. "I
never," he remarked, "heard a more interesting sermon. What a
sublime prospect does Christianity open before us! I wonder how
any intelligent person can reject it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said his father, "it was a very judicious sermon. I was
much delighted with it. We have something to look forward to
when it shall please God to remove us by death; for as I have often
told you, <em>If we are virtuous in this life, we shall be happy in the life
to come</em>."</p>

<p>"But, father," said the son, after a short pause, "if only the virtuous
can attain to a state of felicity in heaven, as we were informed
this morning, what will become of the wicked?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell; and I think that Dr. R&mdash;&mdash; displayed his accustomed
good sense in making no reference to them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, father, we know that the majority in every age, and in
every country, are wicked; and it strikes me, though I confess I
have never thought on the subject before, that if the Deity condescended
to reveal a system of religion, to promote the present and future
happiness of his creatures, he would reveal one that is adapted
to the moral condition of the majority, rather than to that of the
select few."</p>

<p>"We have nothing to do with others; it is enough for us to know,
that if we are virtuous in this life, we shall be happy in the life to
come."</p>

<p>The subject was now dropped till after their father had retired
to rest, when it was resumed. "Your remark on the sermon we
heard to-day," said Miss Macfarlane to her brother, "I think is a
very just one. It certainly demands attention. If the virtuous
only can be saved, the great majority of the human race must
perish."</p>

<p>"Very true; and we know that many who become virtuous in old
age, have been dissipated in their youthful days. Can such persons
expect a state of future felicity as confidently as though they had
always been virtuous? And, after all, what is virtue? It is simply
a line of conduct that runs parallel with the requirements of the
society amongst which we live, and which we know varies so much
in different nations and amongst different people, that what some
call a virtuous action, we should condemn as an outrage on the feelings
of humanity. A Hindoo applauds the virtue of the eldest son,
who sets fire to the pile which is to consume his deceased father
and living mother; but were he to do such a deed here, he would
be execrated as a monster, and amenable to the law. Can we suppose
that the Supreme Being will award a state of future happiness
to a Hindoo, for an action for which he would punish an European,
by excluding him from heaven? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"And beside," said Miss Macfarlane, "how shall we know when
we have acquired that <em>exact degree</em> of virtue which will entitle us to
expect a state of felicity in the life to come? The more I think on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the subject, the more I am perplexed. What shall we do, for I feel
the subject too important to be dismissed?"</p>

<p>After some further conversation, they resolved to examine the
Scriptures, to see if they could gain any information; and providentially
they turned to the fifth chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans.
There they read the following verses with deep interest:&mdash;"For
when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
for the ungodly.... God commendeth his love towards us, in that,
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.... For if, when we
were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life." "Here
we find," said Mr. Macfarlane, "the apostle speaking of the salvation
of <em>the ungodly</em>, of <em>sinners</em>, and of <em>enemies</em>." They proceeded in their
examination, and perceived, from many passages which they met
with in other epistles, that the current language of the Scripture
plainly and unequivocally proves, that the revelation of mercy was
intended to benefit the guilty and depraved as well as the virtuous.</p>

<p>One passage particularly arrested their attention in the second
chapter of St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians&mdash;"And you hath he
quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in time
past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to
the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
the children of disobedience." On reading these verses, Mr. Macfarlane
remarked:&mdash;"We are to remember, that at the period when
Christianity was first promulgated by the apostles, the whole of the
Gentile world was sunk into a state of the grossest ignorance, superstition,
and vice; and though some of its most celebrated philosophers
and statesmen were distinguished for their love of virtue, yet
the immense majority of the people were addicted to almost every
species of gross immorality. If, then, a state of future felicity is
reserved only for the virtuous, and no provision is made for the
salvation of the wicked, the labours of the apostles must have been
restricted to the few who had kept themselves from the moral
corruptions of the age in which they lived. But such an opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
receives no sanction from this passage, which speaks of the salvation
of those who had their conversation in times past in the lusts of
their flesh, 'fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and
were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.'"</p>

<p>On turning their attention to the brief delineation which the
apostle has given of his own character before his conversion to the
faith in Christ, they were struck with his declaration respecting the
design of our Lord's mission. "This is a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world
to save sinners; of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained
mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all
long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe
on him to life everlasting." "You perceive," said Mr. Macfarlane
to his sister, "the apostle says, that Christ Jesus came into the
world to save sinners; and saved the chief of them, as a pattern
for the encouragement of others who may deem themselves equally
guilty, to hope in the mercy of God."</p>

<p>"We thus see," said Mr. Macfarlane, "that the epistles prove that
Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners from a state of
future misery, and to fit them for heaven; but then comes the
question, What degree of dependence ought we to place on their
testimony? May they not have become corrupted in the course
of time? or may not the writers of them have committed some
mistake?"</p>

<p>"So, brother, we have been taught to believe, but it is possible
that we may be mistaken. However, as we cannot now, by any
process of inquiry, decide on the genuineness of the passages which
we have been examining, let us turn our attention to the gospels,
and see if they exhibit the same views on this subject as the epistles.
Because we may fairly infer, that if the whole of the Bible is written
by the inspiration of the Almighty, we shall find a continuity and
harmony of thought running through the various parts of it, and
especially on that paramount question which now engages our attention."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"As it is now getting very late," Mr. Macfarlane observed, "we
will not go into that question to-night; but I will contrive to get
home to-morrow rather earlier than usual, when we will pursue our
inquiries."</p>

<p>"My mind, dear brother, is painfully excited by the discoveries
we have already made, as they have convinced me that our theory
of belief is in direct opposition to that of the apostles, who were
initiated into the Christian faith by the oral instructions of Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>"Yes, this I feel. But still the discovery should not distress us;
it should rather excite our gratitude; for if we find, on more careful
inquiry, that we have been holding false opinions, we can renounce
them, and adopt the true system of belief."</p>

<p>They continued their investigations of Scripture from evening to
evening, sometimes together, sometimes apart, and made rapid progress
in the knowledge of Divine truth.</p>

<p>"I have hitherto thought," said Mr. Macfarlane, as he sat with
his sister one evening, "that Jesus Christ came as a teacher, to instruct
us how to attain to a state of future happiness, and to inculcate
on us, by the purity of his example, the cultivation of the social
virtues. However, on a careful examination of the New Testament,
I feel very much struck with the express reason which He gave to
his apostles, for his coming into the world&mdash;'Even as the Son of
man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his
life a ransom for many' (Matt. xx. 28). He certainly knew what he
came to do&mdash;and he says he came to die&mdash;to die voluntarily, by
giving his life, not giving it as an act of martyrdom, but as a ransom
to redeem many. Now this must refer to the <em>many</em>, in some
condition of danger; not to any select few of the amiable and virtuous,
in no danger."</p>

<p>"I also," remarked his sister, "feel very forcibly impressed with
the reason which Jesus Christ assigns for his going to visit Zaccheus,
who appears to have been before his conversion a great sinner.
'For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
was lost' (Luke xix. 10). There is nothing about teaching, as the
direct import of his mission, but seeking after sinners to rescue them
from the danger of perishing. This harmonizes with the statement
of the apostle Paul, which has already engaged our attention."</p>

<p>"Very true. And if we take for our guidance the undisputed
axiom, that facts determine and explain theory, we may, by a careful
examination of the narratives which are reported by the evangelists,
make some safe progress in the inquiry we are now pursuing
as to the design of the mission of Jesus Christ. You have
been turning your attention to the conversion of Zaccheus, and
I have been turning mine to that of the thief on the cross, both
ranked among the chief of sinners; but both were converted and
saved by faith in Christ. The malefactor, when dying, made his
appeal to Jesus, saying, 'Lord, remember me when thou comest
into thy kingdom' (Luke xxiii. 42). How prompt and benign is
the answer, 'Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me
in paradise!' What a solace this promise must have been to the
poor sufferer&mdash;a bright and soothing prospect in the midst of his
agonies! And with what authority Jesus speaks&mdash;assuming the
right of fixing the final destiny of this dying criminal, and of
advancing him to the honour of associating with him in the celestial
paradise! He must have been something more than man to speak
thus, and to assume such a prerogative, on such an occasion."</p>

<p>"Such a conviction," observed Miss Macfarlane, "forced itself
very strongly on my mind, when reading the Gospel of John, particularly
the following passages, which never attracted my attention
before: 'For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven,
and giveth life unto the world.... And Jesus said unto
them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never
hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.... And
this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth
the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life; and I
will raise him up at the last day.... I am the living bread which
came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give
for the life of the world' (John vi. 33, 35, 40, 51). 'As the Father
knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life
for the sheep.... I and my Father are one' (John x. 15, 30). We
here see that he claims an equality with his Father, which would have
been an act of blasphemy to have done if he were only a man;
he lays down his life of his own accord, for the benefit of man;
asserts that the possession of everlasting life is made dependent on
our believing on Him; and says, that if we do so, He will raise us
from the grave at the last day."</p>

<p>"You have compressed within a very narrow compass, a series of
truths which now appear novel to us both, though we must often
have seen them when reading the New Testament; and which most
certainly are of immense importance, demanding our most serious
attention. Hitherto we have regarded Jesus Christ as a mere man,
though one of a superior order&mdash;surpassing all other men in intelligence
and personal excellencies; but I begin to regard him as God
in the form of man, as on such an hypothesis, all his sayings and
doings, I believe, will be found to harmonize. On coming home this
evening, I stepped into a bookseller's shop, and asked for the best
work on the divinity of Jesus Christ. I bought the one recommended,
and here it is&mdash;<cite>The Scripture Testimony to the Messiah</cite>, by
the Rev. Dr. J. P. Smith. Let us then postpone all further discussion
on the subjects of our present inquiry, till we have carefully
read Dr. Pye Smith's book. When we have done this, we shall be
better qualified to pursue our inquiries, and arrive at some satisfactory
conclusion. There are three leading questions we have to
attend to&mdash;<em>First</em>, What is the testimony of the sacred writers as it
relates to the person of Jesus Christ?&mdash;is he a mere man, or does
he unite in his person the Divine with the human nature? <em>Second</em>,
What is the express purpose for which he came into the world?&mdash;was
it to teach the lessons of wisdom and of virtue, enforcing his instructions
by the purity of his example? or was it for the purpose
of redeeming sinners from some fatal danger? And, <em>third</em>, Are his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sufferings expiatory&mdash;the meritorious cause of human salvation? or
must we look upon them as a contingent evil, inseparably connected
with his mysterious history?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Macfarlane, "these three questions will include
everything we want definitively settled; and I hope the Spirit of
wisdom from above will guide us in our researches, to understand
what is revealed to us in the Bible. I will take, if you please, the
Doctor's second volume, which I see is an examination of the narratives
given to us by the evangelists."</p>

<p>"And I will go through his third volume, which gives us the
testimony of the apostles; and when we have done this, we will
examine together his first volume, which is a record of what the
prophets predicted concerning him."</p>

<p>The absence of Mr. Macfarlane, Senr., for a few weeks, on his
annual visit to a brother who resided in Yorkshire, gave them an
opportunity of devoting their attention more uninterruptedly to the
important inquiry in which they were now engaged. As they advanced,
they felt the evidence in confirmation of the divinity of
Jesus Christ, and his vicarious death, gradually increasing in clearness
and force, till they arrived at the full conviction that he was
the Son of God, on an equality with his Father, though appearing
on earth as the Son of man, and giving his life as a ransom to redeem
the guilty and worthless.</p>

<p>They now began to feel anxious in behalf of their father, who was
living in the rejection of the essential truths of the Scriptures, under
the delusive spell of Unitarian error. They, however, deemed
it advisable to proceed with caution, lest he should peremptorily refuse
to have any discussion whatever on the subject. On the Sabbath
after his return, they excused themselves from going with
him to chapel, which astounded him; but he had too much respect
for the right of private judgment to attempt to impose any restraint.
In the evening, as they were conversing together, he said,
"Why did you leave the intelligent preaching of our learned minister,
to hear the mysterious doctrines of Calvinism enforced? Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
you been as much pleased as you were with the excellent discourse
we heard the Sunday before I left home?"</p>

<p>"The discourse which we then heard," replied his son, "we
thought very excellent; but we were so much struck with the remark
of Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;, that the felicities of heaven are reserved only
for the virtuous, that, on reflection, we could not agree with him;
because on such an hypothesis the vast majority in every age, and
in every country, would be consigned over to a state of hopeless
misery."</p>

<p>"And do you now think that any other but virtuous people will
ever be received into heaven?"</p>

<p>"On searching the Scripture, which we have done with diligence
during your absence, we find that the ungodly&mdash;that transgressors&mdash;that
those who are enemies to God by wicked works&mdash;that the
children of disobedience&mdash;and that the chief of sinners, may be
saved. This new view of the revelation of mercy, which is sanctioned
by the current language of the Bible, appears to us more
consistent with the benevolence of the Supreme Being, and much
better adapted to the real character and condition of the great mass
of mankind, than the statement of Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"By your permission, Papa," said Miss Macfarlane, "I will read
Dr. Doddridge's 'Paraphrase and Improvement of one of our
Saviour's Parables,' which I think is so excellent, and so much in
point, that it will afford you as much pleasure as it has given
me."</p>

<p>"I have no objection to your reading a quotation from Dr. Doddridge,
because I have always considered him a moderate, as well as
a very learned man. I think he is mistaken in his views of some of
the speculative truths of revelation; but I like him as a practical
writer."</p>

<p>The parable is contained in the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel by
Luke, and the paraphrase runs thus:&mdash;"But [Jesus] for the encouragement
of these few penitents, as well as to rebuke the censorious
and uncharitable Pharisees, spake to them this parable, and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety and nine, that were feeding together in the
pastures of the wilderness, and go from place to place in search
after it, and having at length found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
greatly rejoicing, as a man in such circumstances naturally would?
And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
neighbours, and says unto them with great pleasure, My friends,
you may now rejoice with me; for my labour and search have not
been in vain, but I have found my sheep which was lost. And
as he thus is more delighted with the recovery of the sheep which
he had lost, than with the safety of the rest, which had not wandered,
so I say unto you that greater and more sensible joy will be
in heaven among the blessed and benevolent spirits that dwell there,
over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons
which need no repentance, or such a universal change of mind
and character.</p>

<p>"How graceful and lovely does our Lord appear, while thus opening
his compassionate arms and heart to those wretched outcasts,
for whose souls no man cared! Who can choose but rejoice at this
jubilee which he proclaimed among them, and at the cheerful attention
which they gave to these glad tidings of great joy? May
we who are his followers never despise the meanest, or the worst of
men, when they seem disposed to receive religious instruction, but
rather exert ourselves with a distinguished zeal, as knowing that
the joy of the heavenly world, in their recovery, will be in some measure
proportionable to the extremity of their former danger.</p>

<p>"Let us often recollect the charity and goodness of these perfected
spirits, who look down from their own glory with compassion on
mortals wandering in the paths of the destroyer, and who sing anthems
of thankfulness and joy, when by Divine grace they are reclaimed
from them. Let every sinner be touched by a generous
desire that he who has been in so many instances the offender and
burden of the earth, may become the joy of heaven by his sincere
conversion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know, my children," said old Mr. Macfarlane, "that I have
endeavoured to train you up in the paths of virtue, and to give you
what I conceive correct views of religion; but if you on examination
feel dissatisfied with any opinions which I have inculcated, you ought
most certainly to renounce them. You have the same right to think,
and judge, and decide for yourselves, as I have; and I feel too much
affection for you to throw on the path of your inquiry the slightest
shadow of opposition. I know you are virtuous; and if I see you
happy, I shall be satisfied. You will proceed in your inquiries after
truth with caution&mdash;weigh with the greatest nicety the evidence
which may be submitted to you; as many opinions, when they first
strike our attention, appear very specious and plausible, which will
not endure the ordeal of a critical investigation. I cannot give you
better advice than that which the apostle gave to the believers of
Thessalonica, 'Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.'"</p>

<p>"To be candid, my dear father," said his son, "the result of the
investigation which we have been pursuing with close, and I may
say prayerful, attention, is a firm belief in the supreme divinity of
Jesus Christ; and also in the reality and efficacy of the atonement
he made in behalf of sinners by his vicarious death."</p>

<p>"I certainly regret that you should adopt such a belief, which, I
have always told you, is a corruption of Christianity."</p>

<p>"No, father, it is a belief which owes its origin to the concurrent
testimony of the sacred writers. If the sacred writers, and if Jesus
Christ himself had made no statements on this subject, the question
of his divinity would never have been agitated, neither would
the question of his atonement for the sins of the world. If, then, it
be an error, it is one for which they are responsible; they assert
the fact of his divinity so clearly, that I feel compelled to do one of
two things&mdash;either impeach their integrity, or admit his divinity.
To give you a specimen. The prophet Isaiah says, 'His name
shall be called Wonderful, the <span class="smcap">Mighty God</span>;' the apostle Paul says,
'He was <span class="smcap">God manifest in the flesh</span>;' and Jesus Christ himself,
who knew who and what he was, asserts his <small>EQUALITY</small> with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Father, in <em>power</em>, in <em>knowledge</em>, and in his claims on the homage
and love of his disciples. Would the prophets and apostles have
used these expressions if they had been Unitarians believing in
Christ's exclusive humanity?"</p>

<p>"You must not form your judgment from a few isolated passages
of the Bible, which are susceptible of a different interpretation."</p>

<p>"I admit this; but, in the first place, Dr. Pye Smith, and other
men of learning, have proved, that the most correct interpretation
of the passages I have now quoted, is the orthodox interpretation;
however, waiving that debateable point, would any Unitarian, if
left to express his own opinion of the person of Jesus Christ, employ
terms which should allow any one fairly to infer that he is a
Divine Incarnation?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I should think not."</p>

<p>"Then, why have the sacred writers done it? But to proceed: in
the next place&mdash;these isolated passages, dear father, are in exact
harmony with the general statement of all the sacred writers.
Surely we cannot suppose that the very men who were employed
as the agents of a Divine revelation, would be allowed to entrap us
into the double crime of idolatry and blasphemy, by compelling any
one who admits their integrity, to bow down and do homage to
Jesus Christ as to God. There is one fact in the history of our
Saviour, which, in my opinion, may set at defiance the most ingenious
and subtle casuist that ever made an effort to subvert or
mystify human belief. In addressing his opponents, he adopted a
style of speech which stirred up their wrath, and made them accuse
him of blasphemy for making himself God, that is, by trying to
make them believe he was God. Now, father, I put this plain,
common-sense question, Would any good man, especially one so
good as Jesus Christ, when speaking of himself, employ expressions
which should convey to others the idea that he was God in the
form of man, to whom all men are to pay homage, and on whom
all who hope to be saved are to depend for salvation and eternal
life?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a great deal of ambiguity in the language of the Scripture,
which, as the apostle Paul says, is hard to be understood."</p>

<p>"That I admit; but such an admission does not affect the question
before us; which is this&mdash;Would any man of intelligence and virtue,
when speaking of himself, use any expressions which should induce
people to believe that he was God? In fact, would not such an attempt,
if made, as has happened occasionally in modern times, be
considered a proof of insanity? The rejection of the divinity of
Jesus Christ would indeed reduce me to a very serious dilemma.
In the first place, I must impeach the integrity of the sacred writers,
which would compel me to reject the entire system of revelation, as
a gross imposition on human credulity; and, in the next place, I
must look on Jesus Christ as an insane person, or a blasphemer.
I see no alternative between universal scepticism and the devout
reception of the doctrine of the divinity of Christ and his atonement."</p>

<p>"I certainly should prefer what is called orthodoxy to universal
scepticism; but I shall never be able to bring my mind to receive
what I cannot comprehend; and this a believer in Christ's divinity
and atonement is compelled to do."</p>

<p>"This, my dear father, is one of the delusive objections to the
orthodox faith, under which we have too long taken refuge. Why,
is not a Unitarian compelled to believe what he cannot comprehend?
For example, do you not believe in the eternal existence of God&mdash;a
glorious self-existing Being, who lives by the power of his own
volition, with whom there is no variableness neither shadow of
turning?"</p>

<p>"True; though I must confess it never struck me before. This
staggers me. Well, my dear children, our difference on points of
speculative belief will make no alteration in our mutual attachment;
you will remain, I have no doubt, pure and virtuous, as you
always have been; and I trust we shall together participate in the
felicities of heaven, when our earthly course is finished, even if we
should never, as we once did, believe exactly alike."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of the following week, Miss Macfarlane received a
visit from Miss Reynolds, her pious friend already referred to, who
was not more astonished than delighted by seeing her at the chapel
in &mdash;&mdash; Street, on the preceding Sabbath. After a little desultory
conversation, Miss Reynolds said, "We were rather surprised to see
you and your brother at our chapel on Sabbath; but I hope we
shall have the pleasure of seeing you there again."</p>

<p>"Your surprise," replied Miss Macfarlane, "is very natural. Yes,
you will see us again, as we have both decided to attend Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
in future. The system of Unitarianism, in which we have been
educated, we have discovered is delusive&mdash;a fatal perversion of the
theory of revealed truth; and though it may suit the virtuous part
of society, who have no perceptions of the evil of sin, yet, as it makes
no provision for the salvation of sinners, it cannot afford peace to a
wounded conscience."</p>

<p>"And has my dear Eliza at length discovered that she is a sinner!"</p>

<p>"I have not only discovered it, but I have felt it; and I still feel
it. You know how I have repelled such a charge in time past; but
I can repel it no longer. My conscience bears testimony to its
truth. I cannot accuse myself of having violated any of the laws
of social life, but I perceive that I have broken the law of God, and
stand guilty in his sight."</p>

<p>"As this is a new discovery, will you tell me how you made it?"</p>

<p>"The first circumstance which excited our attention was a very
excellent sermon, preached a short time since by Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;, on
the felicity of heaven, which he said was reserved only for the
virtuous. When conversing together on the subject, in the evening
of the Sabbath, my brother said to Papa, If the virtuous only
can attain a state of felicity, what will become of the wicked, who
we know constitute the great bulk of society in every age and in
every country? As his reply gave us no satisfaction, we began to
search the Scriptures, which soon convinced us that even the chief
of sinners could be saved. The subject of inquiry appeared to us
no less important than it was novel; it deeply engaged our attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and we pursued it with intense application. Dr. Pye Smith's
<cite>Scripture Testimony to the Messiah</cite> settled our belief; and now we
feel compelled to withdraw from all religious fellowship with those
who refuse to acknowledge the divinity of Jesus Christ. Knowing,
from your testimony and that of others, that your excellent pastor
stands very high in public estimation, we decided on hearing him,
and I trust that the impression which his discourse made on our
minds will never be effaced. He has given to us, if I may use such
an expression, the clue of a clearer discovery on some important
branches of revealed truth; and now we can perceive beauties in the
sacred volume which lay concealed from our eye, and we can now
understand many passages which had ever before appeared obscure
and inexplicable. But at times I feel a depression of spirits which
I cannot remove; yet it does not proceed from any regret at the
step we have taken, or any mistrust in the truthfulness of our new
belief, but from a keen sense of my personal unworthiness of the
Divine favour."</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced, dear Eliza," replied Miss Reynolds, "to hear you
utter such sentiments. God is dealing graciously with your soul.
He wounds to heal. He has convinced you of the evil of sin, and
unveiled before you that abyss of danger, to which you were exposed,
so as to prepare you for the manifestations of his favour,
beaming on you through the mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"But I fear that the Saviour will not look on me with an eye of
pity, as I have so often insulted him by denying his divinity, and
the efficacy of his death as an expiation for human guilt. I am now
astonished how I could reject doctrines which are so plainly revealed
in the Bible; and sometimes the guilt of my conduct appears
so great, that I am more disposed to despair of mercy than to cherish
the hope of obtaining it."</p>

<p>"If you still persisted in denying his divinity, and rejecting the
atonement which he has made for sin, you might despair of mercy;
but if you admit these essential doctrines of the Christian scheme
of salvation, you may plead the promises of grace with confidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
The Redeemer will execute judgment in the last day upon ungodly
sinners for all the hard speeches which they have spoken against
him, if they die in a state of confirmed impenitence; but if they
repent of their evil deeds and hard speeches, he will, as a faithful
and merciful High Priest, have compassion on them, will intercede
for them, and will save them."</p>

<p>"I now receive these doctrines as essential parts of the system
of revealed truth; but yet I sometimes feel a recurrence of my former
prejudices against them, which causes me unutterable distress.
When pleading the atonement as the foundation of my acceptance
with God, I am tempted to mistrust its efficacy; and when my heart
begins to glow with warm affection for the Redeemer, it is suddenly
chilled and suppressed by the influence of early opinions and associations.
They have taken such a firm hold of my imagination,
that I cannot disengage myself from them; and I fear they will always
continue to perplex and depress me."</p>

<p>"That does not surprise me. It is no easy thing for the human
mind to disengage itself from the influence of early opinions,
even after they have been renounced; but the Lord has laid help
upon One who is mighty, and whose grace will be found sufficient
for you. I would advise you to read the Scriptures with close and
devout attention; but your greatest dependence for deliverance from
your early associations should be placed on prayer. For the judgment
may be convinced of the truth by a logical process of investigation
and reasoning, even while the heart is unimpressed by it;
God having reserved to himself the power of making the truth
effectual to the salvation of them that believe, which power he
exercises in answer to prayer. The language of the psalmist is
very applicable to the present state of your mind&mdash;'Unto thee, O
Lord, do I lift up my soul. Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me
thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the
God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. Remember,
O Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy loving-kindnesses: for they
have been ever of old. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me, for
thy goodness' sake, O Lord.'</p>

<p>"There is one part of the system of revealed truth," continued
Miss Reynolds, "which has not yet engaged your attention, and
as it is one of vital importance, I cannot avoid alluding to it. The
part to which I now refer, is the agency of the Divine Spirit, by
which we become strengthened in our inner man, to receive the truth
in the love of it, and to discharge the high and sacred obligations
which devolve on us. By your permission, I will read to you an extract
from a book which I happen to have brought with me:<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"'As we are indebted to the Spirit for the first formation of the
divine life, so it is He who alone can maintain it, and render it
strong and vigorous. It is his office to actuate the habits of grace
where they are already planted; to hold our souls in life, and to
'strengthen us, that we may walk up and down in the name of the
Lord.' It is his office to present the mysteries of salvation; the
truths which relate to the mediation of Christ and the riches of his
grace, in so penetrating and transforming a manner, as to render
them vital operating principles, the food and the solace of our spirits.
Without his agency, however intrinsically excellent, they will be to
us mere dead speculation&mdash;an inert mass: it is only when they are
animated by his breath, that they become spirit and life.</p>

<p>"'It is his office to afford that anointing by which we may know
all things; by a light which is not merely directive to the understanding,
but which so shines upon the heart, as to give a relish of
the sweetness of Divine truth, and effectually produce a compliance
with its dictates. It belongs to him 'to seal us to the day of redemption,'
to put that mark and character upon us, which distinguishes
the children of God, as well as to afford a foretaste, as an
earnest of the future inheritance. 'And hereby,' saith an apostle,
'we know that we are of God, by the Spirit which he hath given
us.' It is his office to subdue the corruption of our nature, not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
leaving us inactive spectators of the combat, but by engaging us to
a determined resistance to every sinful propensity, by teaching our
hands to war, and our fingers to fight, so that the victory shall be
ours, and the praise his. It is his office also to help the infirmities
of saints, who know not what to pray for as they ought, by making
intercession for them 'with groanings which cannot be uttered.' He
kindles their desires, gives them a glimpse of the fulness of God, that
all-comprehending good; and by exciting a relish of the beauties of
holiness, and the ineffable pleasure which springs from nearness to
God, disposes them to the fervent and effectual prayer which availeth
much. In short, as Christ is the way to the Father; so it is
equally certain, that the Spirit is the fountain of all the light and
strength which enable us to walk in that way.'"</p>

<p>"I assure you, my dear Matilda, both my brother and myself
feel devoutly thankful to the God of all grace, for rescuing us
from the fatal delusion of Unitarianism, which we conscientiously
renounce as an anti-scriptural system, no less derogatory to the
honour of God, than inapplicable to the moral condition of man&mdash;a
system which flatters the pride of the heart, but which makes no
provision for the relief of a wounded conscience; and which, by
placing the hope of final blessedness on the attainment of personal
virtue, supersedes the necessity of the Saviour's death and mediation,
which constitute the most prominent and essential parts of the
grand scheme of redemption."</p>

<p>After the lapse of a few months, Mr. and Miss Macfarlane were
admitted as members into the chapel in &mdash;&mdash; Street, of which the
Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was pastor. They were received into communion
amongst their Christian brethren, with the utmost degree of cordiality
and affection, and are still living, the faithful witnesses of the
truth as it is in Jesus. They had many virtues adorning their
character when they were called Unitarians, but now they carry
their virtue to a greater height, by deriving their motives for its
practice from the authority of God, rather than the praise of man.
While, therefore, they feel it to be their duty still to add to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
"virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance,
patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly
kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity;" they are fully conscious
of their innumerable defects, and wait in humble expectation
of eternal life, not as a reward for their good deeds, but as a sovereign
and unmerited favour.</p>

<h2>THE PATH OF TRUTH FORSAKEN.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_257.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I f all who make a public profession of religion remained
faithful unto death, we should be led to form such
a high opinion of the steadfastness of the Christian
character, that we should never dread any change of
feeling or of principle. But, alas! who has not seen the most ardent
zeal grow cold&mdash;the most fervent devotion degenerate into a lifeless
formality&mdash;and the most spotless integrity become corrupted
by the maxims of the world? Who has not seen the most eager
stopping short in their course; and some, who once bade fair to
occupy stations of honour and usefulness in the church, break away,
either suddenly or gradually, from all their religious connections, to
mingle again with the workers of iniquity, and place themselves in
the seat of the scorner? What more melancholy sight than this can
be presented to the real Christian? and how can he sufficiently
deplore such a calamity? In plaintive accents he often says, "O
that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my
people!" But there are circumstances which sometimes render this
melancholy occurrence peculiarly affecting. If the renegade from
the faith be a near relative, or an intimate friend&mdash;one with whom
we have taken sweet counsel, and walked to the house of God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
company&mdash;one who rejoiced over us "when first we knew the Lord"&mdash;who
poured the soothing words of consolation into our minds
when we first felt the deep convictions of guilt&mdash;who was our guide
and counsellor&mdash;and whom we loved with an ardent and tender
affection&mdash;how much more intense is the pain of such an infliction;
and how applicable that noble passage of Robert Hall to such an
event:&mdash;"Where shall we find tears fit to be wept at such a spectacle?
or, could we realize the calamity in all its extent, what tokens
of our compassion and concern would be deemed equal to the occasion?
Would it suffice for the sun to veil his light, and the moon her
brightness, to cover the ocean with mourning, and the heavens with
sackcloth? Or were the whole fabric of nature to become animated
and vocal, would it be possible for her to utter a groan too deep, or a
cry too piercing, to express the magnitude and extent of such a catastrophe?"</p>
</div>

<p>In the previous chapter I have described the influence of truth
prevailing over long-cherished feelings and deeply-rooted prejudices,
and the substitution of correct evangelical views for the erroneous
tenets of Unitarianism. The history I am now about to record is
of a different description, and presents a melancholy contrast to the
former, exhibiting the abandonment of the faith after a fair and
apparently sincere profession, and teaching us the necessity of constant
labour and watchfulness, if we wish "to make our calling and
election sure."</p>

<p>Henry Beaufoy was the only son of poor but respectable parents,
who resided in the beautiful village of Brookcombe in Devonshire.
This village remained for a long series of years in a state of spiritual
darkness, till it was visited by some of the local preachers of the
Methodist Connexion. At first, when they declared the glad tidings
of salvation amongst the people, they were insulted and reproached;
and the few who received them became a by-word and a proverb
amongst their ignorant and bigoted neighbours. But regardless of
all opposition&mdash;bearing patiently every species of reviling&mdash;and
demonstrating by their gentleness of spirit, that they knew how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
return good for evil, they ultimately succeeded in subduing the prejudices
of ignorance and the violence of bigotry, and established a
flourishing society.</p>

<p>It happened here, as in many other places where the introduction
of the gospel has been opposed, that some of the chief of the
opponents were the first to feel its renovating power. Among this
number the parents of Henry Beaufoy held a distinguished station.
At first they, in common with many others, entertained strong
prejudices against the preachers, and endeavoured to persuade
others from attending their ministry; but at length their curiosity
was awakened, and they went to the chapel. They listened&mdash;the
word came with power&mdash;they felt the deepest contrition for
their past sins, especially their sin of opposing and ridiculing the
gospel of Christ; and eventually became no less distinguished for
their attachment, than they had been for their enmity to the faith.
Their son Henry was about twelve years of age, when this moral
change took place in his parents, and though he felt somewhat surprised
at the suddenness of the transition from the most determined
hostility against the Methodists (as they were reproachfully termed),
to the most cordial attachment, yet he was too young and too
thoughtless to examine into the causes of it. He generally accompanied
them to the little chapel, which was erected under the brow
of a hill; and as he was fond of music, and had a fine voice, he
assisted in leading the psalmody of the congregation. No material
change, however, took place in him, till after he had attained his
eighteenth year; when, being on a visit to Plymouth, he went to
hear the Rev. Samuel Bradburn, who was one of the most celebrated
and one of the most useful ministers of his day. The text from
which he preached on that occasion was selected from Heb. iv. 12&mdash;"For
the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart." Young Beaufoy was struck
with the colloquial simplicity of his style of address, no less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
by the force of his argumentative reasoning; but when he directed
his bold and masterly appeals to the consciences of his hearers, his
heart was deeply wounded, and, like the Philippian jailor, he could
not refrain from saying, "What shall I do to be saved?" On his
return home, the unusual gravity of his manners, his more frequent
attendance at the village chapel, his habit of reading the Bible, and
of retirement for the purposes of devotion, led his parents to indulge
the hope that their Henry was become a new creature in Christ
Jesus, and after the lapse of a few weeks, they had the satisfaction
of hearing an account of his conversion from his own lips.</p>

<p>If it be possible to excite in the soul of a pious parent a feeling
of joy approximating to the pure unmingled bliss of the heavenly
world, it is when his child comes to him to state the fact, and detail
the manner, of the great spiritual change which has taken place in
his heart. It is then that the prayers of the godly father are turned
into praises&mdash;that the deep and tender anxieties of the virtuous
mother begin to cease, as they then can recognize in their son or
daughter, a fellow-heir of the grace of life, with whom they expect
to live for ever and ever.</p>

<p>It was about this period that I first became acquainted with the
Beaufoy family. I had gone to Devonshire for change of air for a
few weeks, and took up my abode in the village of Brookcombe,
where I lodged in the house of the father and mother of young
Beaufoy. I was much pleased both with them and their son, the
latter of whom used frequently to accompany me on my excursions
into the surrounding country. On these occasions we used to have
long conversations together, in which he displayed an intelligence
far above what might have been expected from his position in life,
and this, joined to his amiable temper and pleasing manners, led
me to take a great interest in him. On leaving Brookcombe, I suggested
that he should occasionally write to me&mdash;a proposal which he
received with much satisfaction, and we maintained for a number of
years a close correspondence. Shortly after parting with him, however,
an event occurred which materially changed his prospects in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
life. The same intelligence and amiable qualities which had won
my heart, recommended him to the notice of a wealthy citizen of
London, who came to visit his patrimonial estate in the neighbourhood,
and he gave him the offer of a lucrative situation in his
employment. The offer was accepted, and he prepared to leave the
scenes of his youth. His pious mother, who dreaded the temptations
of London as much as she would have dreaded the plague, said to
him on his departure, "My Henry, I am sorry you are going to
leave us. I wish you could have remained amongst us, and continued
the solace and comfort of your father and myself. But when
you are far away, exposed to the snares and dangers of the great
city, I shall have no sleep at night, for I shall lie awake to pray for
you; and I shall have no peace by day, for I shall be always trembling
for you, my child."</p>

<p>"Oh! mother," said Henry, whose heart was full of the thought
of parting, and whose fortitude began to fail at the sight of his
mother's tears, "do not weep. God can keep me from the temptations
of the city as well as the temptations of the village; and I
have no doubt but I shall escape them. I'll come and see you once
a-year, and then we will rejoice together."</p>

<p>"But how can I endure the thought of looking on you, my child,
only once in the year, on whom I have gazed these one and twenty
years with so much delight! My eyes will be dim with sorrow
before the first year is up."</p>

<p>"But I will write, mother, once a-month."</p>

<p>"But letters can't speak as I have heard you talk for nearly twenty
years. I wish the gentleman had never come amongst us. He has
broken down the fence of our union, and taken away the first-fruits
of our wedded happiness, and what have we left to make up for our
loss? But I know I must be resigned&mdash;yet I have not Abraham's
faith. The Lord bless you, and keep you, and bring you back to
your father's house in peace, that we may bless you before we die."</p>

<p>Henry set off in company with the gentleman who had taken him
under his patronage, and though he felt the pang of separation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
be violent, yet he bore it with firmness, and, turning away his
thoughts from the scene of grief which he had just left, he began
to amuse himself with the varied objects which presented themselves
to him in the course of this his first journey to the metropolis.</p>

<p>On arriving in London, he took lodgings in the City Road, in the
house of Mr. Jordan, whom the reader will remember as the worthy
landlord of Mr. Lewellin.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This was shortly after the return of the
latter from the country, on recovering from the dangerous illness
which had produced so important a change in his moral character.
From residing together in the same house, a close intimacy sprang
up between Mr. Lewellin and young Beaufoy, which was much
strengthened by the similarity of their religious sentiments. Though
belonging to different evangelical bodies, they, nevertheless, zealously
co-operated together in the advancement of all the various schemes instituted
by Christian benevolence, for the promotion of the spiritual
and temporal happiness of our fellow-men. Mr. Beaufoy, who had
received his first religious impressions amongst the Wesleyan Methodists,
and imbibed all their peculiar opinions, very naturally chose
to attend their chapel. They received him with their usual kindness,
and for several years he grew in their esteem and confidence,
as a young man of superior intelligence and decided piety. For a
considerable time I both corresponded with young Beaufoy, and
also, on one or two occasions, when in London, I called on him, and
invariably met with the warmest reception. I frequently held conversations
with him on the subject of religion, and from the deep
interest which he seemed to take in the subject, I believed that he
had indeed become a decided Christian. But how deceitful sometimes
are appearances, and how cautious ought we to be in forming
conclusions from mere external circumstances, however fair the prospect
may be which they present!</p>

<p>Henry Beaufoy possessed a mind admirably qualified for business,
and his abilities, in this respect, enabled him to make rapid progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in the counting-house of his employer, where he soon filled a lucrative
and responsible situation. About five years after his first
arrival in the metropolis, he married a young lady occupying a good
position in society, but who made no decided profession of religion.
She attended the chapel because she had been accustomed to do so
from her earliest childhood, and felt attached to the people amongst
whom her parents lived and died; but she had no clear perceptions
of the nature or design of the gospel, nor had she ever felt its
enlightening or renovating power. She was handsome, amiable,
and intelligent, but she did not possess <em>the one thing needful</em>; and
though her habits and associations were of a religious nature, yet
being destitute of its pure and heavenly spirit, she became a snare
to her husband, by drawing off his mind, by imperceptible degrees,
from things that are unseen and eternal, to those that were visible
and temporal.</p>

<p>Mr. Beaufoy's income was, as already mentioned, considerable,
which, together with the fortune he had with his wife, enabled him
to live in a style far above his early expectations; but he had too
much good sense to involve himself in debt, and too much regard
for his parents to allow them to be in difficulties, while he had
abundance. He often used to say, when in his native village, "I
covet wealth that I may enjoy the luxury of doing good;" and when
Providence granted him his desire, he partook of this source of gratification
to a very large extent. His regular remittances to his
parents exceeded their wishes; while his liberality to the poor, and
every religious institution with which he stood connected, raised
him high in the esteem of his Christian brethren. But, alas! his
spirituality did not keep pace with his prosperity; nor did the
fervour of his devotional spirit equal the degree of his diligence in
business.</p>

<p>In compliance with custom, he spent the first few weeks after his
marriage amidst scenes of gaiety and pleasure&mdash;in receiving and
returning the visits of his friends and associates; and though he
found an apology for this course of life in the example of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
yet he felt it to be injurious to the religious tone of his mind, and
longed to return to his more settled religious habits. Had Mrs.
Beaufoy possessed a similar spirit, this incursion into the land of
the enemy would not have been productive of any essential injury;
but as she was now treading on her native soil, and moving in an
element congenial to her taste, she succeeded in estranging her
husband from the simplicity of a religious life, and induced him to
adopt the habits of the men of the world. The prayer-meeting, in
which his voice had often been heard, leading the devotion of others,
was now deserted for dinner and evening parties. The sacredness
of religious conversation with those who loved and feared the Lord,
was exchanged for the vain and trifling conversation of the votaries
of fashion; and though on the Sabbath-day he was seen in his pew,
yet the marked seriousness and peaceful serenity of his countenance
was supplanted by the knitted brow, or the listless and inattentive
air. The society of his former religious friends, including Mr. Lewellin,
now became less agreeable to him than that of some gay
worldlings, into whose company he was frequently thrown. His
letters to myself also were shorter and more reserved; but I was
still far from suspecting the dangerous nature of the career on which
he was now entering. Thus while retaining a name and a place
amongst the members of the church, he was rapidly receding from
the purity and fervour of the Christian spirit.</p>

<p>One of the earliest symptoms of apostasy from the pure faith of
Christ, is a fastidiousness of hearing, which few preachers can please.
The truth as it is in Jesus is tolerated on account of the form or
the manner in which it is presented; and the messenger is admired
more than the message which he delivers. Though we would not
condemn a predilection for the more graceful and the more eloquent
appeals of the pulpit, nor insinuate that a correct taste is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</i> evidence of a heart in a state of departure from God, yet it
requires no lengthened argument to prove that when the truths of
the gospel are not loved and received for their own sake, and on
account of their beneficial tendency, it is a decisive proof that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
tone of the mind is injured; and that, notwithstanding the outward
appearance of devotion which may be kept up by a professor, he
is not walking in the fear of the Lord, nor in the comfort of the
Holy Ghost. He may have his favourite preachers; but if the truth
which they preach is not esteemed when it is delivered by men
equally zealous, and equally devoted to God, though not equally
gifted, we are supplied with a melancholy symptom of his being in
a backsliding state. It was this spirit of preference for the learning
of Paul&mdash;for the eloquence of Apollos&mdash;and for the peculiar charms
of Cephas, amongst the members of the church of Corinth, that the
apostle regards as an evidence of their indifference to Christ; and
which he adduces as a proof that a corrupt leaven was then working
amongst them. "For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another,
I am of Apollos," is it not a convincing proof, that the speaker is
more delighted with the correctness of the language which a preacher
employs, than the purity of the doctrines which he preaches?</p>

<p>Mr. Beaufoy, on his settlement in London, gave a decided preference
to the most evangelical and the most experimental preachers
in his Connexion; but now he began to admire the most fanciful
and the most florid, to whom he listened as an amateur does to
a piece of music&mdash;more for the gratification of his taste than the
spiritual improvement of his mind; and as he could not always hear
them, he began to absent himself from the chapel when they were
not expected. His habit of attendance at length became so irregular,
that some of his Christian brethren, who had watched with great
anxiety the progress of his defection, felt it their duty to have him
admonished; and they deputed an aged elder, in whom dwelt the
spirit of wisdom and of grace, to visit him.</p>

<p>The manner in which reproof is received often developes the real
temper and disposition of the mind, and supplies us with a good
criterion to form a correct judgment of character. "Let the righteous
smite me," said the Psalmist, when reviewing the imperfections
of his conduct, "it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove
me, it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
And it is by the kind admonitions and the gentle reproofs that we
timely receive from those of our friends who watch over us, that we
are often indebted, under the Divine blessing, for our spiritual prosperity,
and to which we may trace our recovery from that state of
religious declension, to which we are so fatally prone.</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Mr. Beaufoy to his venerable friend, in whose company
he had formerly passed many a pleasant hour, "I think I am
at liberty to attend where and when I please, without being subject
to the inquisitorial interference of others. And though you are
pleased to say, that my late conduct has given my best friends reason
to fear that I am not so spiritual as when they first knew me, yet
you will permit me to say that I am the best judge on that subject."</p>

<p>"You certainly," replied the venerable elder, "are at liberty to
go where you please; but I hope you will not go away from Him
who 'hath the words of eternal life;' and are at liberty to go when
you please; but do not forget the Divine injunction which commands
us to 'consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good
works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
manner of some is.'"</p>

<p>"I hope I shall not, Sir; but I must be permitted to consult my
own taste in the choice of the preachers on whose ministry I attend,
without being censured for any decrease in the spirituality of my
mind. If I do not talk quite so much on religious subjects as I once
did, that is no proof that I feel less; as we become reserved on these
high and awful considerations in proportion as we are impressed
by them."</p>

<p>"The Psalmist says," replied the elder, "'While I was musing the
fire burned; then spake I with my tongue.' I know you are displeased
with me, my brother, for the language which I have addressed
to you; and I assure you, that your displeasure gives me
greater sorrow than the cause of my visit, inasmuch as it convinces
me that your heart is not right with God. I have but a few years
to live, and perhaps only a few hours; and as I may not live to
repeat a visit which is as unacceptable to you as it is painful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
myself, I cannot leave you without giving you and Mrs. Beaufoy a
message from the Lord&mdash;'Take heed, lest there be in you an evil
heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.'"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, Sir, but your motives are good, and that you
deem the solemn admonition of the apostle necessary; but you will
permit us to form our own judgment on the propriety of its
application."</p>

<p>The venerable elder then arose, took his young brother by the
hand, and wept; and after struggling for some moments to subdue
the feelings which were agitating his breast, he said, "My brother,
I fear that you have departed from the Lord, and that his Spirit has
departed from you; but let us kneel together at the throne of grace,
as we used to kneel when the light of his countenance shone upon
you, and pray for its return." He then knelt down, and offered up
a solemn and affecting prayer, which bespoke the fidelity of his
affection for his erring brother. When he arose, he received the
cold thanks of courtesy for his labour of love, and retired under a
strong presentiment that he should see his fellow-member's face no
more. And so it proved; for his feeble frame had received a shock
that evening from which he had not strength to recover. He hastened
home as fast as his tottering limbs would carry him&mdash;partook
of his frugal meal&mdash;read the twenty-third Psalm, and, in company
with his pious housekeeper (for he had buried his wife about six
weeks before this affliction came upon him), he knelt down, and closed
the toils of the day in the hallowed exercise of communion with God.
One petition he presented which he had never been heard to utter
before&mdash;"And if, Lord, it should please thee to call thy servant this
night, I thank thee that I am at last enabled to adopt the language
of Simeon&mdash;'Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for
mine eyes have seen thy salvation.'" This petition was expressed
with an energy of voice which indicated the animation of a mind
feeling its near approach to the prize of its high calling of God in
Christ Jesus. He retired to bed at his usual hour, but he was
restless and feverish; and about midnight he rang the bell. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
housekeeper entered his room, and on drawing aside the curtain
of his bed, heard him say,</p>

<p class="center">
"O! the pain, the bliss of dying."
</p>

<p>He requested her to fetch his pious medical friend, who speedily
arrived, but it was only to confirm his old servant's worst fears.
The dying elder now related to the doctor, as a member of the same
church with himself, the particulars of his visit to Mr. Beaufoy. "I
know," he said, "I am dying, and that in a very few hours I shall
see the King in his beauty; but death hath lost its sting, and I have
lost my fears. I have long waited for my salvation, and now it
is come. I die in full and certain hope of a joyful resurrection to
eternal life. Give my dying love to my dear wandering brother, and
tell him that the language of the prophet is so impressed on my
mind, that I cannot leave the body without expressing a desire that
he will meditate on it. 'Thine own wickedness shall correct thee,
and thy backsliding shall reprove thee; know, therefore, and see,
that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord
thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of
hosts.'" He now gently waved his hand as he repeated the triumphant
language of the apostle:&mdash;"O death, where is thy sting?
O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the
strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who giveth us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ;" and reclining on the bosom
of his friend, he had one strong convulsive struggle, and then expired
with a smile settled on his venerable countenance.</p>

<p>The sudden death of this devout elder, who had been for more
than fifty years an ornament to his Christian profession, produced a
powerful sensation through the whole Society; and many attended his
funeral as an expression of the esteem and veneration in which they
held his character. Deep and heartfelt was the sorrow expressed on
the countenance of the assembled throng on that occasion, and every
one seemed to mourn as though he had lost a father or a brother.
On the following Sabbath, his funeral sermon was preached in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
chapel by the Rev. Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, from the words, "The hoary head is
a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness" (Prov.
xvi. 31). After a correct delineation of the character of the deceased,
he described the closing scene of his life. "He was," said the
preacher, "not only a good, but a devout man, and pre-eminently
endowed by the God of all grace, with a double portion of the spirit
of wisdom and understanding. Tremblingly alive for the honour of
his Master's cause, he would often weep when it was endangered by
the inconsistent conduct of its professed friends; and it was to an
extraordinary excitement occasioned by a visit of mercy to a fellow-member,
that we may ascribe his sudden decease. His tender and
sympathetic spirit yearning over the object of its solicitude, was
thrown into an agitation from which his feeble frame never recovered.
Having finished the work assigned him, he sunk beneath the weight
of his own grief, but not till he had assured his mourning friends
that he died in full and certain hope of a joyful resurrection to
eternal life. Be ye followers of him, who through faith and patience
is now inheriting the promises; and be on your guard, lest, in departing
from the living God, you should bring down the gray hairs of
some venerable elder with sorrow to his grave, whose love may impel
him to manifest a care for your soul." Mr. Beaufoy heard this discourse,
but it was evident by his restlessness, and the indignant look
which he cast towards the preacher, that his pride was mortified, by
the allusions which were made to him.</p>

<p>Fidelity on the part of a minister is essential, not only to his happiness,
but his usefulness; yet when he permits his feelings to overpower
the dictates of prudence, he is in danger of frustrating the
design he wishes to accomplish. He should declare the word of life
without fear; but in administering reproof, he should never be so
personal in his remarks or allusions, as to turn the eyes of an audience
on the individual who may deserve it. By the adoption of such
a course no one would feel secure from attack, when he comes to
hear the message of grace; nor is it likely that the offender will be
reclaimed from the error of his way, when he finds himself made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
spectacle of reproach in the presence of his brethren. Instead of
relenting, he will be hardened; and may be induced to abandon the
place which the angel of mercy visits with his healing power, rather
than remain to receive instruction and reproof. A minister should
always combine the wisdom of the serpent with the harmlessness of
the dove; and while he desires to be faithful in the pulpit, he should
be solicitous to guard against all appearance of personality.</p>

<p>When the power of vital religion is declining in its influence over
the mind of a professor, and he begins to cherish feelings and adopt
habits which are opposed to the purity of his avowed principles, he
will not be able to endure the close appeals of the pulpit. Prudence
will often keep him from making any complaints against the general
fidelity of the ministry, even while his heart is writhing under it;
and his habits of intimacy with his Christian brethren will sometimes
prevent him from leaving a society with which he has formed
a close and a sacred union; but when the principle of apostasy has
gained ascendency over his conscience, and he begins to treat the
friendly remonstrances and admonitions with contempt, he will soon
discover some justifiable cause of offence, and retire in disgust, if not
in wrath.</p>

<p>Thus it was with Mr. Beaufoy. Stung to the quick by the allusions
which the preacher made to the visit of the venerable elder,
and the supposed cause of his sudden death, he left the chapel in
the greatest indignation; and the following morning, he sent his
arrears of subscription to the managers, requesting, at the same
time, that they would consider him as no longer a member of their
church.</p>

<p>On being informed of her husband's abandoning his connection
with the Wesleyans, Mrs. Beaufoy was rather pleased than disappointed,
as she hoped she would now have greater scope for sharing
in the amusements of the gay world. Both thought it right, however,
still to attend some place of worship, and thus keep up the
appearance of respect for the public services of religion. Where to
go, was a question which they could not easily determine; but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
some of their friends, whose acquaintance they had lately made,
attended a Socinian meeting in E&mdash;&mdash; Street, they resolved to go
there on the following Sabbath. This sudden transition, from the
fervid devotion of Methodism, to the frigid apathy of Socinianism,
produced no unpleasant impressions on the mind of his wife, but
Mr. Beaufoy was not quite prepared for it. His heart was become
hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, yet he still believed in
the essential doctrines of Christianity, which retained their dominion
over him, though they had lost their original power of impression.
They were both struck with the gracefulness of the preacher's manner,
and admired his elocution; but Mr. Beaufoy could not renounce
the divinity, or the atonement of Christ, nor could he regard the
doctrine of regeneration as a corruption of the gospel. Mrs. Beaufoy
thought that every modification of Christianity was equally
acceptable to God, but Mr. Beaufoy was capable of distinguishing
truth from error; and while she adopted for her creed the poet's
stanza,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His can't be wrong, whose life is in the right,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">he was convinced that no man ought to be considered a Christian,
who rejected the leading doctrines of revelation.</p>

<p>At length, when expressing his abhorrence of some of the daring
charges which he heard advanced against the orthodox faith, and
which he considered as tending to universal scepticism, she replied,
"Well, my dear, you can very easily retain your own opinions, and
yet attend on Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;'s ministry, because he cannot force you to
believe against the dictates of your own judgment, and if you sometimes
hear them controverted, that circumstance ought not to disquiet
you. As your belief is founded on evidence, and matured by
deep reflection, you are in no danger of being carried about with
every wind of doctrine, but may fairly calculate on your ability to
hold it fast, amidst all the efforts which may be employed to destroy
or disturb it." "Very true," he replied, "I like the morals of Socinianism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
better than the doctrines. Well it shall be so;"&mdash;and so it
was. They took their pew, and occupied it; and as the only restraint
which had kept them for a long time from a more extended course
of gaiety was now removed, they began to walk more openly in the
ways of their own heart, and in the sight of their own eyes. Hitherto
they had kept up some semblance of religion, but now they began
to conform to the customs of the world, and to avail themselves of
the various sources of gratification which its pleasures and amusements
afford. Family-prayer, the last vestige of their former habits
of devotion, was now entirely neglected. The Bible, which they
once revered as their guide to everlasting life, was thrown aside;
and though Mr. Beaufoy could not forget that he had been a religious
man, yet he wished others to believe that now he was a more
happy one.</p>

<p>It has been very justly observed, that when we begin to think
lightly of error we are in great danger of being corrupted by it; and
the experience of all ages proves, that if a professor hold the truth
in unrighteousness, he is ultimately given up to believe a lie. That
there have been many departures from evangelical principles in
modern times no one will presume to deny; but if they were closely
examined, it would be found that they were preceded by a neglect
of private prayer, watchfulness, self-diffidence, and walking humbly
with God; and every one may perceive that they are followed with
similar effects. It has been acknowledged by some who have embraced
the Socinian system, that since they entertained those views
they have lost even the gift of prayer. Perhaps they might draw up
and read an <em>address to the Deity</em>; but they could not pray. Where
the principles of the gospel are abandoned, the spirit of prayer and
all communion with God will likewise depart. The confession of
Peter, that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God, is thought to be
that which our Lord denominates the rock on which he would build
his church. We are sure that the belief of this article of faith was
required as a test of Christianity; and who can look into the Christian
world with attention, and not perceive that it still continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the key-stone of the building? If this give way, the fabric falls.
Relapses of this nature are infinitely dangerous. He that declines
in holy practice has to labour against the remonstrances of conscience;
but he that brings himself to think lightly of sin, and meanly of the
Saviour (which is what every false system of religion teaches), has
gone far towards silencing the accusations of this unpleasant monitor.
He is upon good terms with himself. The disorder of his soul
is deep, but it is of a flattering nature. The declension of serious
religion in him is no less apparent to others than the physical decay
of the body in a consumption, where in each case the party himself
frequently has no suspicion of his danger.</p>

<p>As Mr. Beaufoy had no family, the love of accumulation had less
dominion over his mind than the passion for display, which had
taken an earlier possession of his mind than he himself was aware
of, and to its fatal tendency may be attributed, in a great measure,
all the evils and misery of his subsequent life.</p>

<p>On this subject we may here quote the words of a judicious
writer:&mdash;"We need not affect singularity in things indifferent, but to
maintain a constant endeavour to follow in the train of fashion, is
not only an indication of a vain and little mind, but is certainly
inconsistent with pressing towards the mark for the prize of the
high calling of God in Christ Jesus. The desire of making an
appearance has ruined many people in their circumstances&mdash;more in
their characters&mdash;and most of all in their souls. We may flatter ourselves
that we can pursue these things, and be religious at the same
time; but it is a mistake. The vanity of mind which they cherish
destroys everything of a humble, serious, and holy nature, rendering
us an easy prey to the temptations which are thrown in our
way. A Christian's rule is the revealed will of God; and where
the customs of the world run counter to this, it is his business to
withstand them, even though in so doing he may have to withstand
a multitude&mdash;yea, and a multitude of people of fashion; but if we
feel ambitious of their applause, we shall not be able to endure
the scorn which a singularity of conduct will draw upon us. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
we shall be carried down the stream of this world; and shall either
fall into the gulf of perdition, or if any good thing should be found
in us towards the Lord God of Israel, it will be indiscernible and
useless."</p>

<p>Mr. Beaufoy's amiable disposition, and admirable conversational
powers, made his society courted by an extensive circle of acquaintances.
Balls, parties, and theatres now consumed the hours
of the evenings which were once devoted to reading, meditation,
and prayer; and not unfrequently the sanctity of the Sabbath was
violated by excursions to the country. It was just after they had
made an engagement to take an excursion on the Thames on the
ensuing Sabbath, that Mr. Beaufoy received a letter from his aged
mother, whom he held in the highest veneration, and from whom
he wished to conceal the fact of his apostasy. It breathed a spirit
of gentle reproach and remonstrance, and opened to his view her
agony of mind, occasioned by the intelligence of the defection of her
beloved son from the paths of righteousness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Brookcombe</span>, <em>12th July, 18&mdash;</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Henry</span>,&mdash;You know I always dreaded your going
to London, and now, if what I hear be true, I have cause for my
fears. A friend called on us the other day, and told us that you
had left our Society and become a Socinian. I don't know much
about Socinians, but I understand they say that Jesus Christ is
nothing more than a man, and that we must not expect 'redemption
through his blood, or the forgiveness of sins through the riches of
his grace,' but from our own good works. And have you, my Henry,
forsaken that Saviour whom, unseen, you loved when you lived at
home with us? and have you made a shipwreck of that precious
faith which once filled you with so much joy and peace in believing?
and have you departed from the ways of the Lord for the pleasures
of sin, which are only for a season? We have had no rest since we
received these awful tidings, and the spirit of your poor dear father
is so broken with sorrow, that he has not had a smile upon his countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
since. And can you, my dear Henry, leave the Saviour who
once had compassion on you, and did such great things for you, as
you so often told us of? If you leave him now, how will you be able
to stand before him, when he comes with 'ten thousand of his saints,
to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly
among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners
have spoken against him?' O let me entreat you to return to the
Lord with weeping and supplication, and he will yet have mercy
upon you, and heal all your backslidings; he will accept you graciously,
and love you freely. I cannot give you up, no, I cannot!
You are my child, and I cannot endure the thought of living separated
from you in another world. Let me hear from you directly,
and tell me if you are as happy, and as holy, and as spiritually-minded
now, as when you first believed in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Your father joins me in love to you and dear Sophia, and in beseeching
both of you to consider the error of your ways ere it be too late.
&mdash;Your affectionate mother,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Amelia Beaufoy</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter shook the unhallowed purpose of his soul, and neither
he nor his wife could venture on their excursion up the river. It
brought over their imagination the scenes of departed bliss&mdash;revived
recollections which were sacred and subduing&mdash;and plunged Mr.
Beaufoy into deep mental agony. Mrs. Beaufoy, however, was of a
more heedless turn of mind, and endeavoured to assuage her husband's
grief by saying, "You know you still believe the gospel;" but
she had no power over the anguish which was consuming his happiness.
"Yes," said he, "I do believe it, or this letter would not
disquiet me. I have departed from the Lord, and I am gone past
recovery. Mine is no common apostasy. My doom is fixed. My
end will be awful. Where, ah! where can I go when he cometh
'to execute judgment upon all?' Yes, I do believe the gospel. I
feel I do. I believe it, and tremble. Its terrors are upon me. The
piercing language of the prophet has been following me ever since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the death of that holy man, whose warning voice I despised, and
now they enter as fire into my bones: 'Thine own wickedness shall
correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know, therefore,
and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken
the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the
Lord God of hosts.'"</p>

<p>The Lord employs various means to recover his people from a
backsliding state; and though for a season he compels them to feel
the evil and the bitterness of their sin, yet he finally restores unto
them the joy of his salvation. When, however, an apostate has
been given up to the hardness of his heart, neither the language of
mercy, nor the terrors of judgment will produce any other effect
than that of accelerating the dreadful catastrophe. He goes on from
bad to worse, till at length he comes to the fearful end of his career.
Thus it was with Mr. Beaufoy. The extreme agony into which he
was thrown by the simple appeals of his mother's letter gradually
abated; but he felt it necessary to adopt some new and extraordinary
expedients, to gain some small degree of tranquillity. His attachment
to his wife was strong, and it had gained such ascendency over
him that he refused to leave his home except she accompanied him;
but now a melancholy gloom was cast over all his pleasant things,
and those from which he had extracted the sweetest comforts of life
became as bitter as wormwood to his taste. Though he forbore, at
this early stage of his mental anguish, to reproach her as the cause
of his apostasy, yet he secretly laid the sin to her charge, and began
occasionally to feel that her society aggravated the evil, which her
kindness prompted her to attempt to alleviate. He became reserved,
refused to attend any place of worship, and often stayed from home
to a very late hour. At first Mrs. Beaufoy hoped that another sudden
change would take place, and bring back the domestic happiness
of former times; but at length she was awakened to a full discovery
of the extent of the misery by which she was surrounded. Her
husband was no more the interesting and affectionate companion of
her retired hours&mdash;no more the attentive and fond lover. He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
now a thoroughly dissipated character, rarely returned home till long
after his wife's eyes had become heavy by watching for him; and
when he did, it was only to exhibit his own disgrace, and torture her
feelings. She would sometimes venture to remonstrate with him,
and hang over him with all the affection of former days, when he
would relent, and pledge himself to change his course; but he had
lost the power of self-control, and felt compelled to seek for ease
from the anguish of his spirit amidst scenes of convivial mirth and
folly.</p>

<p>The whirl of dissipation and the riot of intemperance are expedients
to which many resort when trouble comes upon them; but
they increase the evils sought to be removed; for though a temporary
exhilaration of the spirits may be produced, and the fearful
forebodings of future woe driven away for a short season, it is only
to make them return with redoubled force to inflict keener anguish.
A voice is sometimes heard speaking from the celestial glory, saying,
"Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee;" but
that voice cannot be heard amidst the revelling and excitement of
a theatre or tavern. It speaks to the penitent sinner when he is
alone&mdash;bowed down beneath his burden and despairing of help. Retire
then, thou poor backslider, from the haunts of evil&mdash;and yet
hope for mercy. Thy guilt is great, thy wound is deep, but there
is virtue in the balm of Gilead when applied by the great Physician.
Go, then, into thy closet, shut the door, confess thy sins, shed the
penitential tear, and implore forgiveness. Here others have acknowledged
their iniquities, and here they have obtained consolation.
Your case may be desperate, but it is not hopeless; and though you
may be tempted to despair, yet resist those whisperings of Satan,
which, if listened to, would seal your final doom.</p>

<h2>THE FRUITS OF APOSTASY.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_280.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">As many months had now elapsed since either Mr. or
Mrs. Beaufoy had been to any place of worship, the
latter availed herself of an opportunity which occurred
to allude to it, when her husband replied, "I wish you
to go, Sophia, for it is enough that one of us perish." Dreading the
return of his paroxysm of agony, she diverted his attention from
the subject, and endeavoured to soothe and cheer his spirits. She
so far succeeded as to bring over his countenance the pleasant smile
of former times, but little did she imagine that this pleasing sign
was so soon to be obliterated. The servant entered the parlour with
a letter, which she gave to her master. He placed it on the table
and sat musing for some minutes. He wept, though unconscious of
the tear that involuntarily trickled down his cheek, and sighed, as
if unconscious that any ear was listening. He again took the letter&mdash;pressed
it to his lips, and wept, and sighed again, as though he
thought himself alone. "Yes, my mother, I know thy hand, and if
thou knewest the agony of my heart, thou wouldst pity me." He
opened it; but he had not read many words before he started from
his seat, as if wounded by an invisible hand, then, with firmly
pressed lips, perused the letter, threw it on the floor, and was retiring
abruptly from the room, when he recognized his wife. "What's
the matter, Henry?" she exclaimed, as she attempted to follow him.
"Read that," he sternly replied, pointing to the letter, and, suddenly,
walking to the door, left the house. Mrs. Beaufoy, with trembling
hand, picked up the letter and read as follows:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Henry</span>,&mdash;Your father is no more: he died last night,
just as the clock was striking eleven. He ne'er smiled on us after
he heard that you had forsaken the Lord, and he went to the grave
mourning. He said just before he died, 'Tell my dear boy, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
is still my son, that my last tear was shed on his account.' When
I wiped off the big tear that was rolling down his cheek, he became
composed for a few minutes, and then prayed, 'O Lord God, heal the
backslidings of thine Ephraim,' and died before he could finish the
supplication.</p>

<p>"And now, my son, you have broken your father's heart, I grieve
to say it, and, I believe, will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow
to the grave. O! consider your dreadful state, and how fearful to
think of, should you be suddenly cut off in it! Remember your
dear father's last words.</p>

<p>"I feel quite unable to write you a longer letter to-day. If you
can come down to the funeral, I need not say how glad I should be
to see you; if not, may the Lord reclaim and bless you.</p>

<p>"I know you love Sophia, and I wish you to love her; for she has
been a kind wife to you, and a most attentive daughter to your
father and myself, but I fear she has been a snare to you. If she
had feared the Lord she would have kept you from evil. May the
Lord bless and reclaim you both.&mdash;Your bereaved mother,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Amelia Beaufoy</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>On reading this communication, Mrs. Beaufoy's conscience smote
her, and she wept long and bitterly. Then perusing it anew, she
exclaimed, "Cruel charge! A snare to my husband! the cause of his
being led astray! cruel charge! Is it not enough for me to bear
his unkindness, without having to endure such reproaches?" She
threw the letter from her, and rose, endeavouring to cast off the
load of sorrow which oppressed her spirit. "I cannot endure it. I
am of all women the most miserable. I have no one to share my
grief. Oh death!&mdash;no!&mdash;I am not prepared to die." She resumed
her seat, and though the letter possessed a sting sharper than that
of a scorpion, she took it, read it again, and again it wounded her.
"If she had feared the Lord she would have kept you from evil."
"Cruel charge! I have tried to keep him, but could not." She
paused, then could only ejaculate, "Woe is me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The ringing of the bell announced the return of Mr. Beaufoy;
but his dark, lowering look bespoke the inward conflict. On taking
his seat his eye caught sight of the letter near the place where he
had thrown it down a few hours before. Moving back, as if from
an adder, he said, "Have you been reading it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Henry, I have."</p>

<p>"And what do you think of the charges?"</p>

<p>"They are cruel."</p>

<p>"Rather say, they are just, though severe."</p>

<p>"You know that I have often attempted to reclaim you."</p>

<p>"But did you not first lead me astray? Till I knew you I was a
happy, because a religious man; but from that ill-fated hour when,
enticed by your influence and example to abandon the house of
prayer for the theatre and ball-room, I have had no mental peace.
I have forsaken God, and he, in anger, has forsaken me."</p>

<p>"But why recriminate on me the guilt of your own sin? You
have withdrawn from me your love and your society, and will you
now in exchange give me your reproaches? If we have sinned
together, and provoked the Lord to anger, let us now kneel together
before his mercy-seat, and together confess our sins, and implore
forgiveness."</p>

<p>"You may pray and obtain mercy, but I cannot; no, I cannot."</p>

<p>"The Lord waits to be gracious."</p>

<p>"Yes, to the penitent, but my heart is too hard to feel penitential
sorrow."</p>

<p>"But is not the Redeemer exalted to give repentance?"</p>

<p>"To <em>you</em> he will give it, but not to <em>me</em>. I have fallen away, and
incensed justice renders it impossible to renew me again to repentance,
for I have crucified the Son of God afresh, and put him to an
open shame."</p>

<p>"But justice relents when a sinner prays, and mercy"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! speak not of mercy."</p>

<p>"But mercy rejoiceth over judgment."</p>

<p>"Yes, but when mercy is rejected, as in my case, justice avenges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the insult in a terrible form. Let us change the theme, Sophia. I
am too full of agony to dwell on it. It awakens recollections that
I wish to banish for ever. It is like handling the deadly weapon
which is to extinguish life."</p>

<p>"The blood of Christ, dear Henry, cleanseth from all sin."</p>

<p>"But I have counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was
sanctified an unholy thing."</p>

<p>"But, Henry, is He not still able to save to the uttermost all
that come unto God by him; and have you sinned beyond his recovering
grace?"</p>

<p>"I know my doom," he curtly replied.</p>

<p>It is not always in our power to ascertain the precise moment
when the Divine Spirit begins the good work of grace in the heart,
nor yet to say what specific means he employs to effect it, but sometimes
an unpremeditated effort to convey instruction, or warning, or
consolation to another, is made to re-act on the speaker to produce
the great change. Thus it was in the experience of Mrs. Beaufoy.
She felt the force of her own remarks, and when reflecting on them,
at a subsequent period, she could not but yield to their influence.
The charge brought against her, of having led her husband astray,
she <em>now</em> admitted to be just. But what an admission! to be not
merely accessory to his apostasy, but the primary cause of it&mdash;not
merely a partaker of his guilt, but the means of its contraction and
its accumulation. Her sin, which had been concealed from her, <em>now</em>
started up in all its aggravated form and appalling aspect. "Yes,
'tis true; if I had feared the Lord, I might have kept him from going
astray, and we might have been walking in his commandments and
ordinances blameless. I enticed him from the paths of righteousness,
and into what an abyss of misery are we both plunged! I remember
the night when I first induced him to leave the house of prayer to
accompany me to the theatre, and I remember the anguish of his
spirit after our return. I then told him that he would not injure
his principles by yielding sometimes to the customs of the world,
but alas, I was deceived! I alone am to blame, and if I could suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
alone, I would patiently endure the terrible inflictions of justice I
have merited. But alas! I have raised the storm which has long
since laid waste all our domestic felicity, and which is now threatening
a deluge of wrath! Where, O where, can we take refuge from
the impending evil!"</p>

<p>As she was thus bemoaning her unhappy state, she thought of her
long-neglected Bible, and taking it from the book-case, she pressed
it to her lips and prayed for grace to understand and feel its instructive
and consolatory truths. On turning over its pages, her eye
caught the following passage, which in a few moments mitigated in
a slight degree the agitation of her mind&mdash;"And a man shall be as
an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as
rivers of water in a dry place; as the shadow of a great rock in a
weary land." But as there are</p>

<p class="center">
"No wounds like those a wounded spirit feels,"
</p>

<p class="noind">so there is</p>

<p class="center">
"No cure for such, till God, who makes them, heals;"
</p>

<p class="noind">and though her distressed spirit was lifted up above the overwhelming
flood, yet it was still enveloped by the gloom of desponding fears.
She attempted to pray, but her heart was too tightly bound by mental
anguish to give vent to her grief. Hitherto she had borne her
sorrows with an unbending spirit, and usually wore a placid aspect
when in the company of her husband or her other friends; but now
her countenance was changed, and it was evident her soul was in
trouble.</p>

<p>"You appear unhappy," said her husband, one day, on finding her
in tears; "is it on my account or your own?"</p>

<p>"I am unhappy on your account, Henry, and I am unhappy on
my own; and I know not where to go for relief. I feel the justice
of our dear mother's charge, though I deemed it cruel at the time.
I have indeed led you astray, and am the guilty cause of all the
misery into which we are both plunged. If I could suffer alone, it
would be an alleviation of my anguish, but I cannot. O, Henry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
return with me to the Lord, from whom we have departed, and as
we have sinned together, and now suffer together, let us enter his
presence, and confess our guilt; and then his anger will be turned
away, and he will comfort us."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> may obtain mercy, Sophia, but <em>I</em> cannot; yours have been
the sins of ignorance, but mine have been committed against the
clearest light and the deepest conviction of their aggravated guilt.
You may plead the promises of the Bible, as a sinner under the first
convictions of sin; but I bear upon me the reproach of having forsaken
the God of my mercies; and while there are no obstructions
in the way of your access to the throne of grace, that throne is
guarded by a flaming sword which turneth every way to keep me
off from touching the sceptre of mercy. I know my doom, and I
deserve it."</p>

<p>He continued in this frame of mind for many months; and though
he abandoned the society of his former companions, and the haunts
of evil which he had been accustomed to frequent, yet no arguments,
however weighty, or entreaties, however urgent, could induce him
to revisit a place of worship, or resume his practice of family devotion.
At length an insidious disease, which had long been undermining
his constitution, began to manifest itself, and it was evident
that his course in this world was fast coming to an end. He was
urged to try change of air; and with this view he proceeded with
his wife to the pleasant village of Parkdale, from which I was somewhat
surprised, shortly after my return from Fairmount, to receive
a letter written by Mrs. Beaufoy, earnestly beseeching me to come
and see her husband, as she feared he had not long to live, and
had expressed a wish to see me. My intercourse with Mr. Beaufoy
had been completely suspended for some years past. As already
mentioned, his letters first became shorter and more reserved, and
at length ceased altogether. On one occasion that I called on him
in London, his manner was so dry, and expressed so little cordiality,
that I felt convinced my visit was disagreeable, and, consequently,
never repeated it. On hearing, however, of his lamentable defection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
from the path of truth, I deemed it my duty to address two or three
letters to him on the subject; but to none of these did I receive any
answer. When at Fairmount, Mr. Lewellin informed me that he
had seen nothing of Mr. Beaufoy for a long time, as latterly he had
become quite estranged from his early friends, and established himself
in the midst of gay and irreligious society. On receiving the
above communication, I at once resolved to proceed to Parkdale,
about forty miles distant, in the earnest hope that I might be of
some benefit to Mr. Beaufoy, whom, notwithstanding all the past
coolness between us, I still continued to regard with considerable
interest. On my arrival, I found that I had been anxiously expected
by his wife, who appeared to be much relieved at seeing me,
and after a short conversation, led me to her husband's room. He
received me with strong expressions of affection, and regret for his
past rudeness and neglect. "O! Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," he exclaimed, "this is
indeed kindness to come and see a poor dying wretch, whose conduct
has been so deserving of censure. I have been a wicked man, an
undutiful son, and a renegade from the faith; and now I feel a dagger
thrust through my heart, which can never be removed."</p>

<p>"Dear Sir," I replied, "there is one Physician who can remove it,
and one specific that can heal the wound."</p>

<p>"I know it. I do not doubt his power, as that would be an insult
to his omnipotence; but I cannot believe in his willingness. No,
I cannot!"</p>

<p>"But which is the greatest insult, to doubt his ability to save
to the uttermost, or his willingness? Has he not said, 'Him that
cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out?'"</p>

<p>"But, Sir, the passage which you have now quoted, is addressed
to sinners under the first convictions of sin, and not to apostates
who have fallen from their former steadfastness. My doom is fixed,
and you have only to read the words of the prophet to know its
nature. 'Because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged,
thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have
caused my fury to rest upon thee.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why, my friend, should you appropriate that awful passage
to your condemnation, when you live under a dispensation of grace,
which has made provision for the salvation of the chief of sinners?"</p>

<p>"I do it, Sir, because I know and feel that it is a debt of justice
which I owe to the insulted grace of Heaven. That passage is the
only one in the Bible on which I can dwell with any degree of ease."</p>

<p>"But can you derive any mental ease from reflecting on a passage
which denounces indignation and wrath?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, because then I sink to the level of my condition, and
silently approve the equity of the sentence; but when a promise of
mercy recurs to my mind, its involuntary stirrings to embrace it
throw me into a more agonized state of feeling. But I do not complain.
I deserve all I suffer, and all I have to suffer, and I will submissively
bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned
against him."</p>

<p>"May you not hope, that this spirit of submission to the righteous
manifestations of the Divine displeasure, is a proof that you are not
totally abandoned by him; for if that were the case, you would feel
disposed, either to impeach the goodness, or murmur against the
justice of God?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir, I am not abandoned by him! If I were, I should enjoy
the fatal ease of <em>unfelt</em> guilt. I am held in bondage, I am alive to
the peril of my state, and am compelled by the irresistible convictions
of my conscience to admit the equity of my condemnation, but
I dare not hope for any symptoms of returning mercy. Returning
mercy! No, mercy is clean gone for ever."</p>

<p>"Nay, my friend, the mercy of the Lord endureth for ever; he
delights in it, and I have no doubt but the Sun of Righteousness
will break in upon the midnight darkness of your soul, and cheer
you with the returning light and bliss of hope."</p>

<p>"O! speak not to me of mercy or of hope! You do but agonize
me with fresh tortures."</p>

<p>"But will you not admit that God <em>can</em> turn away his anger from
you, and comfort you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"I admit, Sir, that all things are possible with God, which are in
accordance with his purity and his justice; but I do not think that
he can renew me again unto repentance, because I have crucified to
myself the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. I
wish, therefore, you would allow me to remain undisturbed by any
allusions to mercy, as such allusions bring to my recollection joys
that are past, never to be recalled, and plunge me deeper and deeper
in the abyss of mental agony. O that I had passed from the nuptial
altar to a premature grave! then I should have been resting in
peace; but I will not reproach. May my sad doom operate as a
warning to others against a departure from God."</p>

<p>I was much distressed at this scene, but still did not abandon
hope; and, therefore, at the urgent solicitation of Mrs. Beaufoy,
consented to remain with them for a few days. His disorder continued
to increase, and on the morning after my arrival, he consented
that his mother should be sent for&mdash;a proposal which he
had hitherto always rejected, as his attachment to her, which was
sincere, made him averse to occasioning her any alarm. On receiving
the intelligence of his illness, which had hitherto been concealed
from her, she hastened to Parkdale. Her son, on hearing
of her arrival, said to his wife, "Conceal from my dear mother
the state of my mind; she cannot help me, and if she knows that I
die in despair, she will never taste another drop of comfort in this
vale of tears." As she entered the room, he raised himself on his
bed and embraced her, and they wept in silence together for some
minutes.</p>

<p>"And why, my son," she remonstrated, "did you not let me know
of your illness before now? I would have come and nursed you as
I used to do long ago."</p>

<p>"I hoped that I should recover, mother, and I was unwilling to
alarm you."</p>

<p>"Well, my son, I hope the Lord is dealing graciously with your
soul now you are in the dark valley?"</p>

<p>"He is dealing righteously."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my child, he always deals righteously; but is he dealing
graciously?" A long pause ensued.</p>

<p>"But why are you silent, my son? Tell your mother how the
Lord is dealing with you."</p>

<p>"He is dealing righteously with me, and it is our duty to bow in
submission to His will."</p>

<p>"I am happy to hear that you are resigned to His will; that is a
proof that He is dealing graciously. May the Lord continue to bless
you, my dear child, and may He lift upon you the light of his countenance
and give you peace."</p>

<p>On resuming her inquiries next day, she asked him, "Have you a
good hope through grace, of being presented faultless before the presence
of the Lord with exceeding joy?"</p>

<p>"To throw off the veil of concealment which I wished to rest over
the state of my mind, I confess, my dear mother, that I have no
hope."</p>

<p>"No hope, my child! Not one cheerful beam of hope! Is the
Lord's arm shortened, that he cannot save? or is his ear heavy, that
he cannot hear?"</p>

<p>"No; he is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; and it is his
immutability that plunges me into despair."</p>

<p>"How so, my dear son?"</p>

<p>"He is immutable in his threatenings against those who depart
from him."</p>

<p>"And is He not immutable in his promises of mercy to those who
<em>wish</em> to return?"</p>

<p>"But there are no promises of mercy that suit my case."</p>

<p>"No promises! Why, don't you recollect what our blessed Lord
said, 'Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out?' And
don't you recollect what Paul says, 'Wherefore he is able also to
save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him, seeing he ever
liveth to make intercession for them?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I have gone away from Him who hath the words of
eternal life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then come back; He will not cast you out. Does the shepherd
refuse to take back the lamb into his fold, which has happened to
stray from him?"</p>

<p>"But I have no strength to return."</p>

<p>"But you can pray; and as the shepherd goes to look after the
strayed lamb, when he hears his bleating, so our blessed Lord will
have compassion on you who may be out of the way, and will not
suffer you to perish, if you wish to return to him. Don't despair of
mercy, my son, while our blessed Lord lives to intercede for the chief
of sinners."</p>

<p>These tender appeals coming from the lips of his mother, reduced
his spirit to a more composed state, and for the first time he wept.
When she saw his tears, she wept with him, and said, "I am glad to
see you weep; it is the first sign of returning mercy."</p>

<p>"Mercy! no!" he replied; "mercy, I fear, will return no more!
I have despised and insulted mercy, and am consigned over to the
offended justice of Heaven. It must be a miracle of mercy to recover
me from the ruin I have brought upon myself."</p>

<p>"Very true, my child; and mercy often performs a miracle of
grace; and if you look by faith to Christ, he will recover you, and
he will put a new song into your mouth, 'even praise unto our God:
many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.'"</p>

<p>On the evening of the day following his mother's arrival, as we
were all standing round his bedside, she asked him if he yet felt
more composed, or if he could indulge a good hope of future happiness.</p>

<p>"Composed, mother! No, I am in perfect anguish, and expect to
be lost."</p>

<p>"But he who raiseth the whirlwind, and directeth the storm, is the
God of salvation; and though he allow all his waves and his billows
to go over you, yet he will command his loving-kindness in the daytime;
and when the thickest darkness of the night comes upon you,
then his song shall be with you, and your prayer shall be unto the
God of your life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"O mother, I am about to leave you, and you, my wife; and I
leave you with a full conviction that we shall never meet again.
A few hours will decide the long-agitated question&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
'Am I his, or am I not?'
</p>

<p class="noind">I wish you would retire and leave me, nor suffer any one to disturb
me, as I wish to be alone for a little. I shall ring the bell when I
am prepared to see you again."</p>

<p>We withdrew to an adjoining room, when his mother said to his
afflicted wife, "This is a solemn moment. You are about to lose a
husband, and I a son; but if it should please the Lord to visit him
with the light of his reconciled countenance, I trust we should then
be enabled to bow down in submission to his sovereign will." I
then, at their request, knelt down and prayed, as Elijah prayed
when he besought the Lord to send forth the rain of heaven to refresh
the parched lands of Israel. When I had finished, old Mrs.
Beaufoy said, "Let us go and see if there be yet any signs of returning
mercy." "But," said her daughter-in-law, "perhaps he is now
wrestling with the Lord, and if we go we may disturb him and ruffle
his spirits." Such, however, was the yearning of his mother's heart,
that she could not refrain from going to listen, if, peradventure,
she might hear something to comfort her. She heard him repeat
again and again, "Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me! Lord, save,
or I perish!"</p>

<p>Just as she was returning to inform us that the silence of despondency
was broken by the voice of prayer, the bell rang, and we
entered the room together. "Well, my child," said his mother, "I
hope the Lord is now dealing graciously with you." "He is dealing
righteously; and against the equity of his conduct I can raise no objection.
He is just when he takes vengeance."</p>

<p>After a long pause, during which time the terror of unabated
agony was depicted in every countenance, he raised his down-cast
eyes towards heaven, and, with a feeble voice modulated to the subduing
tenderness of the expression, he said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would light on some sweet promise there,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Some sure support against despair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He now became exhausted, and reclining his head on the pillow,
fell asleep, and slept several hours. When he awoke, he was composed
and calm, and said, "My sleep has been refreshing to me."</p>

<p>"I hope," said his mother, "that your soul is refreshed, as well as
your body."</p>

<p>"I am more composed than I ever expected to be, but I am not
happy. My composure is no less a source of terror than my former
agitation, as I know that the cessation of pain is sometimes an indication
that the disorder is approaching a fatal termination, even
when the patient may be anticipating his recovery."</p>

<p>"But, my friend," said I, "the terror you feel under your composure,
is a proof that you are unwilling to seize a premature hope;
and may be regarded as an evidence, that the Lord who refused to
appear in the whirlwind, in the earthquake, or in the fire, is graciously
appearing in the still small voice of love."</p>

<p>"Oh, my old and tried friend, my sins appear too great and too
aggravated to be forgiven."</p>

<p>"But, Henry, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin;
and He is sent, not only to proclaim liberty to the captive soul, but
to heal the broken-hearted."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed, "I would believe. Lord, help my unbelief."</p>

<p>Death was now rapidly approaching; and having pressed the
hands of each of us, he reclined his head on his wife's bosom, and
fainted away. On recovering from this fit, which lasted several
minutes, he once more opened his eyes, and casting a mournful
look on us, said, "I die an unworthy and guilty sinner at the foot
of the cross; but will He permit me to perish when crying to Him
to save me? Impossible!" he exclaimed; and then, as if having
exhausted all his strength by this last effort, his head fell back on
the pillow, and he expired.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus died Henry Beaufoy, who, in his youthful days, bade fair to
exhibit, in after life, an example of the beauty and consistency of
the Christian character; but having been seduced from the paths of
wisdom and of piety, he entered upon a career of evil, which at
length brought him to a premature grave. His submission at the last
to the visitations of Providence, as an infliction which he deserved;
and the avowal he made, when yielding up the ghost, gave to his
surviving friends <em>a hope</em> that he died in the Lord, and is at rest from
his sorrows; but still gloomy shadows would sometimes fall upon
their spirits, and they often sighed and wept over his memory, as
of one who had come short of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>As female influence is so powerful, and has often been employed
to seduce the man who fears the Lord, from the paths of righteousness
and the ways of peace, let him be on his guard when about to
form a connection for life, and not suffer beauty and accomplishments
to become a substitute for decided piety. He may think
that he shall be able to withstand every ensnaring art, and every
fond entreaty, and that he shall ultimately gain over his wife to
the obedience of faith; but in this he may be deceived, and have
cause to mourn over the consequences of his imprudence, when it
is too late. But if a man should violate the sanctity of the Divine
law, and marry a woman who is not decidedly pious, let her be on
her guard, lest she become the cause of his moral ruin. Let her
beware of enticing him to a theatre, or an evening party, when his
inclinations would take him to the house of prayer&mdash;let her beware
of manifesting a spirit of indifference or hostility to the practice of
family devotion, which his conscience constrains him to observe.
She may not regard such proceedings as wrong, or likely to prove
injurious to the reputation or the happiness of her husband, but
she may be mistaken; and if her persuasions or her indifference
should prove successful, as is too often the case, she may be called
to feel the bitter consequences of her folly and her guilt, amidst the
wreck of domestic happiness. She may suppose, that the religion of
her husband, like her own, has nought to do with the inner man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the heart, and that it may be thrown aside, and resumed, as caprice
may dictate, but she is mistaken; and if she should induce him to
abandon it for a season, she may live to be stung by his reproaches,
and tortured by her own, when he is brought to suffer the due reward
of his deeds.</p>

<p>From the preceding sketch, which has been taken, not from the
conceptions of my own fancy, but the facts of real life, we may see
that it is an evil thing to forsake the Lord God; and though his
tender mercy may stoop to recover the backslider just as he is
sinking into despair, yet he seldom throws the light of his countenance
over the death-bed of such an individual. I am aware
that some employ the partial and the final apostasy of professors,
as an argument to prove that our perseverance in religion is quite
precarious and uncertain, depending solely on ourselves, without
any regard to the counsel of Jehovah. That it does depend on ourselves,
I admit&mdash;but not solely. We are to walk in the ways of the
Lord; but he has promised to uphold our goings, that our footsteps
slip not. We are to cleave to him with full purpose of heart; but
he has promised never to leave us, nor forsake us. We are commanded
to keep ourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy
of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life; but he has promised to
keep us by his power through faith unto salvation. We know that
the beginning of the work of grace in the heart, is to be ascribed to
the immediate operations of his power; and it is to be viewed as
the commencement of a continued series of operations, which will
ultimately issue in the salvation of the soul. And though the faith
of some may be overthrown, "nevertheless, the foundation of God
standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.
And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from
iniquity." His designs will be accomplished, but accomplished in
a natural way. They do not supersede the necessity of our exertions.
They do not suppose that we are passive machines, acted on
by some supernatural power; but living agents, endowed with a
Divine principle, which works within us "both to will and to do."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
They do not relax our obligations to watchfulness&mdash;to prayer&mdash;to
an avoidance of evil&mdash;and to the cultivation of the spirit and habits
of devotion, but increase them; and the reciprocal influence of our
exertions, and of the concurrence of Divine strength, is so nicely
balanced in the purpose of grace, that while we are compelled to
ascribe to God the honour of our preservation and final salvation,
yet we are made responsible for every act of transgression and disobedience.
"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take
heed lest he fall" (1 Cor. x. 12).</p>

<p>One of the chief causes of decay in religion, is our forgetting
that the means necessary for first bringing us to God, are no less
essential for retaining us steadily in a close walk with him. To
watch and pray was no less the duty of the disciples, when they had
left all for Christ, than when they first approached his presence, and
sought his pardon and love. He has prayed that we may be kept
from the evil of the world; but we must look for an answer to this
prayer&mdash;in our choice of good, and rejection of evil&mdash;in the control
of our passions&mdash;and in the integrity and uprightness of our conduct.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that apostasy begins in the closet; secret
prayer is at first carelessly performed&mdash;then occasionally omitted&mdash;and
then entirely neglected. When this is the case, the religious taste
becomes fastidious&mdash;a roving habit is often indulged&mdash;the customs
of the world are yielded to, and the principle of sin, which once lay
dormant in the heart, rises up with renewed strength, and breaks
forth in open manifestations of evil. This process in moral degeneracy
may be slow or rapid, according to the degree of influence
which circumstances may be permitted to supply, but when it has
once begun, it is always going on; and though it may not be in our
power to assign the <em>primary</em> cause, yet too much secular prosperity
is generally one of the most operative. The more a Christian is
indulged with temporal blessings&mdash;the higher he or his family rises
in the world&mdash;the more he ought to have his heart glowing with
love and gratitude to God. But so inveterate is the depravity of
human nature, that uninterrupted prosperity imperceptibly deadens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the best affections of the soul, which becomes so completely engrossed
in worldly objects and pursuits, that religion is rarely
thought of but on Sabbath, and even then it is entangled and
mixed up with the things of time and sense. When prosperity
comes thus to act on a person who possesses only the form of godliness,
while destitute of its power, its fatal effects may be looked for
with almost perfect certainty.</p>

<p>Another cause of the evil which we are so often called to deplore
is the indulgence of a speculative turn of mind in matters of religion.
We are commanded to search the Scriptures&mdash;to prove all
things, and hold fast that which is good. When this investigation
is pursued from a pure motive, and a spirit of prayer attends it&mdash;keeping
the mind in a teachable and devotional frame&mdash;the greatest
benefit will be the result. But when once the Word of God is
treated with levity&mdash;when liberties are taken with it&mdash;when one
part of it is impugned as mysterious, another rejected as apparently
contradictory&mdash;when its doctrines are denounced, as incomprehensible,
and its precepts objected to, because they are too unaccommodating
to the habits of the age&mdash;an evil spirit enters into the heart,
which first corrupts it and then entangles it in a labyrinth of error.
This spirit of unbelief commences its operation by reducing the
magnitude of the evil of sin; the necessity and then the reality
of the atonement is rejected; prayer is considered useless; the influence
of the Holy Spirit in the renovation and sanctification of
the heart is denied; and then the apostasy becomes complete.</p>

<p>But one of the most prevalent causes of this evil is an adoption
of the principles and a compliance with the customs of the world.
There are some customs which exist amongst us to which we must
conform; but there are others from which we are commanded to
abstain. We may mingle with the men of the world in business,
and also in social life; but we are to have "no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them." We may,
in common with others, have our social enjoyments, and partake of
the innocent recreations of life, without sustaining injury to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
morals or our Christian reputation; but if we venture to cross the
line which separates the lawful from forbidden ground&mdash;if we
form habits which the spirit of the gospel condemns, and venture
into those places of amusement to which the children of folly are
so much attached&mdash;though we may not immediately feel their corrupting
influence, yet we shall become bitterly sensible of it at last,
when the evil is beyond our control. We may silence the remonstrances
of conscience, by resolving not to depart from the ways of
righteousness, and may affect to treat with contempt the kind admonitions
of our more pious friends; but by no species of artifice
shall we be able to form a junction between the spirit of Christ and
the spirit of the world; or retain the fervour of devotion within the
walls of an assembly-room or a theatre. The experiment has been
often made, and the result always proves morally disastrous. In
some instances the professor has passed from all connection with pure
spiritual religion, into a state of confirmed indifference or avowed
hostility; in others, he has retained the form, while he has lost the
spirit of devotion, and the closing scene of his life has been occupied
by the most heart-rending reproaches and the bitterest lamentations
of misery and woe.</p>

<p>As apostasy from the faith and purity of the gospel, from whatever
causes it may proceed, invariably inflicts on the apostate, when
awakened to a clear perception of his sin and danger, the most awful
and agonizing mental sufferings, I wish to do all that is in my
power to arrest his progress ere it be too late, and lead him back
to the source of pure felicity, which he has forsaken. I would ask
him if the gaieties, the follies, and the amusements of the world,
afford him such substantial happiness as he once enjoyed, when he
walked in the light of God's countenance? I would ask him if he
does not often regret the exchange he has made? and as often condemn
himself for his folly and ingratitude in having made it? I
would ask him if he does not wish to return once more to taste that
the Lord is gracious&mdash;once more to feel that Christ is precious&mdash;once
more to partake of the peace which passeth all understanding&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to live, as in the early days of his profession, in the sublime
anticipations of eternal glory? I would ask, Have you never made
the attempt? As time advances, are you not gradually sinking into
a state of mental dejection, from which you see no chance of being
delivered? I do not propose these questions to inflict fresh torment,
or increase the anguish which presses upon your guilty conscience,
but to induce you to return to the Lord from whom you
have departed, that you may again experience his loving-kindness,
and that your prayers, mingled with songs of praise, may again
ascend to the God of your salvation.</p>

<p>In illustration of this subject, I shall here conclude by quoting
the following from a deceased divine:&mdash;"If you ask, But how am
I to return? how am I to regain my long-lost peace? I answer, In
the same way in which you first found rest to your soul, namely,
by repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>"In general, I may observe, the Scriptures assure us of the exceeding
great and tender mercy of God, and of his willingness to
forgive all those who return to him in the name of his Son. It is
necessary that we be well persuaded of this truth, lest instead of
applying as supplicants, we sink into despair. If a sinner, newly
awakened, be in danger of this species of despondency, a backslider
is still more so. His transgressions are much more heinous in their
circumstances than those of the other, having been committed under
greater light and against greater obligations; and when to this is
added the treatment which his conduct must necessarily draw upon
him from his religious connections, he may be tempted to relinquish
all hopes of recovery, and consider himself as an outcast, both from
God and man. Unhappy man! Thy sin may be great, and the
language of an awakened conscience may suggest, Who can heal
me? Yet do not despair. 'Hear what God the Lord will speak.
He will speak peace unto his people and to his saints: but let them
not turn again to folly.'</p>

<p>"There are circumstances which may render it almost impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
for forgiveness to be exercised amongst men; and therefore men
are ready to think it must be so with respect to God. 'But with
the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous redemption.'
He will not only pardon, but pardon abundantly: 'for his
thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways. For as
the heavens are higher than the earth, so are his ways than our
ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts.&mdash;The blood of Jesus
Christ his Son cleanseth from all sin.&mdash;If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.' The threatenings against the unpardonable sin
itself do not affect the truth of these merciful declarations: for that
sin is all along described as excluding repentance, as well as forgiveness.
The party is supposed to be given up to hardness of heart.
If, therefore, we confess our sin with contrition, we may be certain
it is not unpardonable, and that we shall obtain mercy through the
blood of the cross.</p>

<p>"But the great question is, How we shall repent of our sins,
and return to God by Jesus Christ. Undoubtedly it is much easier
to get out of the way, than to get in again; to lose the peace of our
minds, than to recover it. Sin is of a hardening nature; and the
farther we have proceeded in it, the more inextricable are its entanglements.
But, however this be, we either do desire to return,
or we do not.</p>

<p>"If my reader be in such a state of mind, it is with a mixture of
hope and tenderness that I attempt to point out to him the means
of recovery.</p>

<p>"I would recommend you to embrace every possible season of
retirement for reading the Holy Scriptures, especially those parts
which are suited to your case, and accompany your reading with
prayer. God's Word hid in the heart is not only a preservative
against sin, but a restorative from its evil effects. It both wounds
and heals; if it rebukes, it is with the faithfulness of a friend, or if
it consoles, its consolations will melt us into contrition.</p>

<p>"Read especially those parts of Scripture which are addressed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
persons in your situation, as the second chapter of Jeremiah; or
those which express the desires of a returning sinner, as the twenty-fifth,
thirty-second, thirty-eighth, fifty-first, and hundred and thirtieth
Psalms. You may not be able to adopt all this language as
your own; but, nevertheless, it may be useful. To read the genuine
expressions of a contrite heart, may produce at least a conviction of
the disparity between the frame of mind possessed by the writer
and yourself; and such a conviction may be accompanied with a
sensation of shame and grief.</p>

<p>"It is also of importance that you read the Scriptures <em>by yourself</em>.
To read a portion of them in your families is right, and ought
not to be neglected; but there is a great difference, as to personal
advantage, between this and reading them alone. Your mind may
then be more at liberty for reflection; you can read, and pause, and
think, and apply the subject to your case.</p>

<p>"It is of still greater importance to unite prayer with it. Reading
the Word of God and prayer are duties which mutually assist
each other: the one furnishes us with confessions, pleas, and arguments,
while the other promotes solemnity and spirituality of mind,
which goes farther towards our understanding of the Scriptures than
a library of expositions.</p>

<p>"It was in one of these seasons of retirement that David put up
this petition, 'I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant,
for I do not forget thy commandments.' He seems to have had in
his thoughts the condition of a poor wandering sheep, that had left
the flock and the rich pastures where it was wont to be led, ranging
rather like a native of the woods, than one who had been used to
be led, and fed, and protected by an owner. Bewildered by its own
wanderings, entangled in the thorns and briars of the wilderness,
and exposed to beasts of prey, it feels its forlorn condition, and bleats
after the shepherd and the flock! Is there nothing in this that may
suit your case? Yes, thou art the man! Thou hast gone astray
like a lost sheep, got entangled in thine own corruptions, and
knowest not how to find the way back; yet it may be thou hast not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
utterly lost the remembrance of those happy days before thou wert
led to deviate from the right path. Let thy prayer then be directed,
like that of the psalmist, to the good Shepherd of the sheep: 'Seek
thy servant.'</p>

<p>"Prayer is a religious exercise which is necessary to accompany
all others. 'In every thing by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
let your requests be made known unto God.' Solemn approaches
to God are adapted to impress the mind with a sense of
sin, and to inspire us with self-abhorrence on account of it. It was
by a view of the holiness of God that Isaiah felt himself to be a
'man of unclean lips;' and it was by conversing with the Lord that
Job was brought to abhor himself, and repent in dust and ashes.
The very exercise of prayer carries in it an implication that 'our
help must come from above;' a truth which in all cases it is absolutely
necessary for us to know, and with which, in this case especially,
we cannot be too deeply impressed. We easily get out of the
way; but if ever we return to it, it must be by His influence, who
restoreth our souls and leadeth us in the paths of righteousness for
his name's sake.</p>

<p>"To tell a person who is out of the way, that he has no help in
himself, and that if ever he get in again it must be by the restoring
grace of God, may seem to some people paradoxical and disheartening;
but it is a truth, and a truth which, if properly understood and
felt, would go farther towards our recovery than we at first may
apprehend. Paul found that 'when he was weak then was he
strong,' and many others have found the same. The more we are
emptied of self-sufficiency, the more sensibly shall we feel our weakness,
and the more importunately implore that the Lord would save
us, and restore us.</p>

<p>"This was the way in which we at first found rest for our souls,
and this must be the way in which we recover it. An awakened
sinner frequently labours hard after peace, without being able to
obtain it. Wherefore? 'Because he seeks it not by faith, but by the
works of the law.' In all his labours there is a large portion of self-righteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
hope, or an idea that God will pity him on account of his
endeavours to please him. But if ever he obtain peace, it must be
by utterly despairing of all help from himself; and falling, as a sinner
entirely lost, into the arms of sovereign mercy. This is walking
in the good old way, which brings rest to the soul; and the same
sense of our insufficiency which is necessary to find rest in the first
instance, is equally necessary to find it on all future occasions.</p>

<p>"We may pray from year to year, and all without effect. It is
only the 'prayer of faith' that succeeds; the distinguishing characteristic
of which is a sense of there being no help in us, and a laying
hold of the mercy and faithfulness of God, as revealed in the gospel.
David for a time <em>groaned</em>, and even <em>roared</em>, 'by reason of the disquietness
of his heart;' but he obtained no relief from this. On the
contrary, he sunk deeper and deeper into despondency. At length
he betook him to another manner of praying: 'Out of the depths
cried I unto thee&mdash;and thou heardest my voice!' We find him here
pleading the exceeding greatness of God's mercy, and the plenteousness
of his redemption. Here he found rest for his soul! Jonah
also for a time was in much the same state. With a conscience so
far awakened as to deprive him of all enjoyment, he retired to the
bottom of the ship; and, wearied with the load of his guilt, slept
away his time. Even the horrors of a tempest did not awaken him.
At length being roused and reproved by heathens, and marked out
by lot as the guilty person, he confesses who he is, and what he
had done, and advises them to cast him into the sea. Humanity
struggles for a time with the elements, but in vain; he must be
cast away. Think what must have been his state of mind at this
time! He is thrown into the deep, is swallowed by a fish, and retains
his reason even in that situation; but no light shines upon
his soul. Conceiving himself to be on the point of death, his heart
sighed within him, 'I am cast out of thy sight!' But ere the
thought had well passed through his mind, another struck him,
'Yet will I look again towards thy holy temple!' He looked, and
was lightened: 'Out of the belly of hell cried I unto thee, and thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
heardest my voice! When my soul fainted within me, I remembered
the Lord; and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy
temple.'"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<h2>THE FARM-HOUSE KITCHEN.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_303.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I n the parish of Woodford, about twenty miles from the
town where I resided, there were a few cottages, pleasantly
situated on an eminence which commanded a
beautiful and extensive view of the surrounding country.
They were principally occupied by the peasantry who were employed
on the neighbouring farms. No less than five church spires
could be seen rising in the distance, from amongst the trees, of different
parishes; but they were too remote for the aged and the infirm
to visit, and the more robust and healthy were also very ready to
plead the length of the way as an excuse for their non-attendance at
public worship.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Annesley, a Dissenting minister in the village of Woodford,
on passing this hamlet one summer evening, had his attention
arrested by an interesting looking young man, about the age of four
and twenty, who appeared to be in the last stage of a decline. He
presented to him a few religious tracts, which the young man received
with an air of indifference; but when informed that they were
intended to prepare him for that world into which he was likely
soon to enter, he seemed pleased, and said, "That is what I want,
Sir." This young man, who was the son of a respectable farmer,
lived about two months after the first interview Mr. Annesley had
with him; and died avowing his entire dependence on the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Jesus Christ for eternal life: blessing God in the most simple and
ardent terms, for his goodness in sending to him at the eleventh hour
a knowledge of the way of salvation.</p>

<small>THE REAPERS' HYMN OF PRAISE.</small></p>

<p>Vol. ii. page 285.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After his death, the old farmer, his father, when lamenting that
they enjoyed no religious advantages in that remote part of the
parish, very readily consented to have his large kitchen licensed for
preaching; and Mr. Annesley engaged to give them a sermon on
Tuesdays every week. When he commenced his labours he had to
pass through the ordeal of mockery and contempt. Sometimes he
was insulted by the poor rustics, when attempting to explain to
them the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but by visiting them
in their own cottages, and displaying a kind and affectionate disposition,
he gained their confidence and esteem, and they pressed to
hear him with devout and earnest attention.</p>

<p>Having resolved to make an excursion to Woodford, and pay a
visit to this rural place of worship, of which I had often heard, I
took my seat in the coach, one afternoon in the month of September,
as far as the village of Woodford, from which it was a walk of three
miles to the farm-house. The weather was unusually hot for the
season of the year; but towards the evening, the cool breezes which
sprung up made me enjoy my journey exceedingly.</p>

<p>After getting down from the coach, I quitted the village by a
cross road, and then turned aside into a fine shady lane. On passing
by a farm-yard, I observed an extraordinary rush of men, women,
and children, and being anxious to know the cause of it, I
advanced into the yard, where I saw a group marching before the
last load of com, which they were bringing from the field, and singing
the following, as a harvest hymn of praise:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But now his hand hath crown'd our toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We joy like those that share the spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The harvest home to bear:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With shouts the laughing pastures ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With grateful hearts we reapers sing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The praise of heaven's eternal King,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Through whose paternal care we bring<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The produce of the year."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<p>I tarried some time, intermingling my feelings with those of the
enraptured swains, and participating with them in this feast of innocent
delight; but on looking at my watch I found that I must
hasten onwards, or I should be deprived of the higher gratification
of witnessing a more interesting and a more important sight. On
proceeding up the lane that led to the rural temple of devotion,
I occasionally heard the harmony of Zion's strains, which became
more distinct and impressive as I drew nearer, till at length I was
enabled to catch the following words which the congregation were
singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shall I beneath thy gospel stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And hear the call of grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And at the awful judgment-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Be banish'd from thy face?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I got into the passage just as Mr. Annesley arose to pray, but I
did not choose to advance, lest I should disturb the devotions of the
little assembly. While standing there, two ladies approached towards
the door, and, like myself, waited in silence till the prayer
was ended, when we all entered together. Our appearance excited
considerable attention, but whenever we had taken our seats, every
eye was attentively directed towards the minister. To one who has
been accustomed to offer up his prayers and his praises, in the fixed
and appropriate language of our national liturgy&mdash;and to listen to
the enunciation of life and immortality within the walls of a church&mdash;the
scene of rustic simplicity exhibited in this farm-house kitchen
must have appeared very singular. Mr. Annesley stood in a corner
of the room, his Bible lying open before him on a small round
deal table, the family clock ticking behind him; his rustic audience
was variously disposed of&mdash;some sitting on the dresser to his right,
others in the chimney-corner to the left, the majority on forms in
front of him, and a few bending forwards from the passage, being
incapable of gaining admission. As they were singing the hymn
which intervenes between the prayer and sermon, an expression
which I had recently met with came to my mind, and with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
force, that no external decoration was wanted to render either the
place or the truth more acceptable to my taste&mdash;"A religion without
a Saviour, is the temple without its glory, and its worshippers
will all desert it." Just as the minister read his text, the countenances
of several changed; all were attentive, and appeared to
have forgotten the toils and the fatigues of labour, while listening
to the discourse, which was founded on the following words of Jesus
Christ:&mdash;"But there are some of you that believe not" (John vi.
64). He had not been speaking long, before my spirit involuntarily
said, "Here is religion with a Saviour, and wherever his truth is
preached, there he condescends to dwell."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;"><a name="kitchen" id="kitchen"></a>

<p>Vol. ii. page 286.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sermon delivered was simple, perspicuous, and well calculated
to fix the attention of the audience. The figures of illustration
and description were selected from the rural scenes and occupations
with which the congregation were familiar; and from the
looks, the tones, and the actions of the speaker, it was evident that
he was really in earnest, and desired to impress his hearers with
his own views and feelings. When expostulating with those who
did not believe, he suddenly paused, his eyes, more than half suffused
with tears, told more forcibly than language could express,
how deeply he felt; while his lips, quivering with tremulous anxiety,
gave utterance to the interrogation&mdash;"<em>Why won't you come to Jesus
Christ, and be saved?</em> Do you think you need no Saviour? Impossible!
Do you imagine that he is unable to save you? Do you
suppose he is unwilling to save you? Impossible! Do you think
you are in no danger of being lost? Do you imagine that the misery
of a lost soul is less terrible than the Scriptures represent it? or that
the happiness of a redeemed spirit is less joyous? Impossible! <em>Why
then won't you come to Jesus Christ, and be saved?</em>" No profound
arguments were employed in pressing on the attention of his rustic
audience these pointed questions, and yet they came with an almost
irresistible force. As the people were retiring, I heard some
of them saying to one another, "Ah! why don't we come to Jesus
Christ, and be saved?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Being seated nearly opposite the two ladies who entered along
with me, I could not avoid noticing the behaviour of one of them,
which contrasted strongly with the simple and devout attention of
the cottagers. Sometimes she listened with apparent seriousness,
but more than once the smile of contempt and the look of scorn
seemed to gather on her countenance; and at one part of the sermon,
when the preacher was speaking of the entire depravity of
the human heart, she made an effort to leave, but was apparently
prevented from doing so by her friend. When, however, this simple
question fell from Mr. Annesley's lips, she became still and
thoughtful, and I observed tears fall from her eyes, an unconscious
response to the earnest appeals of the preacher.</p>

<p>After service I introduced myself to Mr. Annesley, who insisted
on my spending the night at his house. On our talking over the
occurrences of the evening, I mentioned what I had noticed in the
conduct of one of the ladies, and expressed my belief that her heart
was penetrated by what she had heard. "If, Sir," he remarked,
"that lady should be converted, she will be a living witness of the
truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and afford a strong corroborative
testimony of its Divine origin. I have," he added, "no personal
acquaintance with her; nor was I aware that she was present
this evening, till I saw her leaving at the conclusion of the service,
but I have long known her character; she resides at Hollyton, a
village about a mile and a half distant, and, I believe, is one of
the most agreeable women you could meet with in society, but she
is a professed infidel; and though most of her relatives and friends
are religious, she will rarely consent to attend any place of worship
with them. She says that the scheme of salvation is a cunningly
devised fable, got up by the priesthood, and palmed upon our hopes
and fears by the policy of our rulers; and unhesitatingly avows that
it is the duty of every person, who feels a proper respect for the dignity
of the human species, to employ all his influence to dissipate
the delusion. She will not, I understand, enter into any discussion
on the Christian religion, because, she says, no evidence could induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
her to believe it&mdash;no, not if she had seen the miracles performed
which are ascribed to Christ and his apostles&mdash;and often quotes the
inconsistent conduct of its professors, to show that its moral tendency
is unfavourable to the growth of virtue. The lady who accompanied
her is of a very different stamp, and a pious member of
the church. I presume her influence has induced Mrs. Farrington
to attend our meeting this evening. I trust that she may yet be led
to see and repent of her errors."</p>

<p>"I am mistaken," I remarked, "if her scepticism has not received
its death-blow to-night. She will be thinking soon about coming
to Jesus Christ to be saved."</p>

<p>"Amen. The Lord grant that it may be so."</p>

<p>I then referred to the interesting scene I had witnessed on my
way to the farm-house, and was informed by Mr. Annesley that the
labourers whose festivities I had witnessed, belonged for the most
part to his regular congregation at Woodford, and were in the employment
of Farmer Hopkins, one of the most esteemed and influential
members of his church.</p>

<p>The next morning, as we were sitting at breakfast, a note was
handed to Mr. Annesley from Mrs. Farrington, requesting that he
would be so kind as call on her in the course of the forenoon. She
added, that she understood he had a clerical friend with him at
present, whom she had observed at the meeting on the previous
evening, and that she would feel much gratified if he would accompany
him.</p>

<p>"Your discourse," I observed, "has already borne fruit."</p>

<p>"I trust so," he replied. "You will of course go with me on
this visit to Mrs. Farrington's. I have never been in her house,
and I should like to have a friend with me, more especially as she
seems anxious for it herself."</p>

<p>I would have excused myself, on the ground that I had already
been longer absent from home than I had intended; but my objections
were overruled, and I consented to remain another night with
Mr. Annesley, and return to town next morning. In the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the forenoon, we proceeded to Mrs. Farrington's, and were received
by her with the utmost courtesy. She mentioned that she had recognized
me the previous evening as a clergyman in &mdash;&mdash;, whom
she had once heard preach, and on her way home she had learned
that I was to be the guest of Mr. Annesley for the night. She endeavoured
to assume her accustomed ease and sprightliness of manner;
but still I felt persuaded that she was labouring under strong
mental depression, which she was anxious to conceal. The conversation
turned on the scenery around us, which had now assumed the
beautiful autumnal tinge; and when Mrs. Farrington pointed to a
double row of fine elm trees, whose thick and extended branches
overshadowed a lovely walk in the front of her cottage, I could not
refrain from repeating the following lines of Cowper:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"Meditations here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May think down hours to moments. Here the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May give a useful lesson to the head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learning wiser grow, without his books."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Farrington, "to quote from the same author&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have ofttimes no connection. <em>Knowledge</em> dwells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heads replete with thoughts of other men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Very true," said Mr. Annesley, "and hence we sometimes see
those who are endowed with the greatest intellectual talents, and
enriched with the largest stores of knowledge, acting the most foolish
parts in the drama of life, and terminating their career without any
hope of a blissful immortality." This allusion to a future world,
threw a shade over the countenance of Mrs. Farrington, and more
than once she endeavoured with difficulty to suppress a sigh.</p>

<p>"We have high authority for saying," I remarked, "that it is not
good for the soul to be without knowledge; but considering the relation
in which we stand to God, and our condition as sinners against
his righteous government, there is no knowledge so essential to our
happiness, as a knowledge of his character, and the way in which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
favour is to be conciliated. Without this, we are left in absolute
uncertainty respecting our final destiny, which must be perplexing
and alarming, in proportion as we seriously meditate on the capabilities
of the human soul to suffer or enjoy in a future state of
existence. Hence arises the desirableness of a revelation of the
will of God; and the advantage of having such a revelation, when
made, committed to writing, that it may be preserved from the
corruption and uncertainty to which oral tradition is necessarily
exposed. This revelation we have in the sacred Scriptures; its
purity and adaptation to our moral condition are strong internal
evidences of its genuineness; and I am at a loss to conceive how
any one can reject it, without destroying his own peace of mind. It
delineates our character, as guilty, depraved, and unhappy, with the
most perfect accuracy; and points our attention to a Saviour, who
came to save and to bless us, and to fit us for a nobler life than we
can ever live on earth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Farrington became deeply affected, burst into tears, and left
the room, but soon after returned, offering as an apology for her
weakness and her rudeness, as she termed it, an excessive nervous
irritability under which she was then labouring. After a moment's
pause, Mr. Annesley said:&mdash;"Pray, Madam, is not your mind now
powerfully affected by those religious truths which you once rejected
as the fallacious opinions of man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," she replied, "it is, and has been since I heard you
preach last night in Farmer Rogers' kitchen. I have hitherto rejected
the gospel as a cunningly devised fable, and generally looked
with pity or contempt on those who embraced it, but then I was convinced
of its divinity, and by the force of an evidence which I had
not previously examined."</p>

<p>"What fresh evidence of the divinity of the gospel," said Mr. Annesley,
"did you receive last night, for I do not recollect advancing
any?"</p>

<p>"The evidence of experience," she replied, "for the gospel came
not in word only, but in power, and I could no longer resist it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Curiosity led me to that sequestered house of prayer; and at first
I was disposed to treat the whole affair with contempt. The pride
of my heart rose up against the statement which you gave us of
the entire depravity of our nature, and I should have left in disgust,
had not my friend prevented me; but when you proposed that
simple yet important question, '<em>Why won't you come to Jesus Christ,
and be saved?</em>' I felt as though an arrow had pierced my soul, and
from that hour till now, I have been suffering the agonies of a
wounded spirit. I could get no sleep last night, reflecting on my
condition; and early this morning I despatched a messenger to your
house, with the note which you received. I feel deeply obliged for
the promptness with which you and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; have responded to
my request, in coming to see me."</p>

<p>"But," inquired Mr. Annesley, "as the interrogation you refer to
was no direct proof of the Divine origin of the gospel, how came it
to produce such a conviction in your mind?"</p>

<p>"I have been revolving that question, and it has created some
strong doubts of the correctness of my present belief; but yet now
I can no more reject the gospel as false, than I could before receive
it as true. That interrogation came with a power which was superhuman,
and its impressions on my heart bore the stamp of the same
agency; and now, Sir, the only question which I wish resolved is
this: May I be permitted to hope that that Saviour whom I have
so long rejected, and so often and so grossly insulted, will ever condescend
to cast one tender look of compassion on me?"</p>

<p>"In the conversion of a sinner," said Mr. Annesley, "it pleases
God to display his sovereignty, no less than his power and his
grace; and hence he generally accomplishes it in a way which compels
us to acknowledge his direct and immediate agency. Had he
chosen to convince you of the Divine origin of that system of truth,
which you have so long rejected, by the slow and rational process of
a logical argument, your judgment might have been convinced,
while your heart remained unaffected by its awful and sublime
communications; but by convincing you of your guilt, and of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
danger, and of the necessity of a Mediator and a Saviour, he has
rendered that argumentative process unnecessary, in compelling
you at once to seek the consolations of mercy as essential to your
happiness."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, Sir, they are essential to my happiness, indeed they
are, but I fear they will be withheld. What plea can I urge for
mercy? On what basis can I rest a hope of acceptance?"</p>

<p>"It is usual," Mr. Annesley replied, "for a person who is just
awakened to a belief of the gospel of Christ, to suppose that its consolations
are far beyond his reach, whilst he stands in dread of its
awful denunciations; but this is a delusion which fear practises on
the imagination. In the operations of Divine truth on the heart,
there is a natural process observed on the part of the great invisible
Agent who conducts it; the convictions of personal guilt, connected
with an apprehension of merited punishment, prepare the way for
the reception of pardon and salvation, as the free gifts of God."</p>

<p>"Am I then to consider what I suffer and what I dread as preparatory
visitations of Divine grace, to compel me to take refuge in
Christ from the wrath to come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam. The feelings which you now experience, and which
excite so much alarm, are intended to prepare you for the manifestations
of the Divine favour and love. You have now to fix your
attention on Jesus Christ, who is able and willing to save all who
come unto God by him. And hear the encouraging and consolatory
language he employs&mdash;'All that the Father giveth me shall come
to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out' (John
vi. 37)."</p>

<p>"But what reason have I to believe that such gracious words
relate to myself?"</p>

<p>"Their insertion in the Bible is your authority for so applying them
to yourself. But lest you should suppose that this gracious declaration
was designed, in any sense, for the exclusive relief of those to
whom it was originally given, the revelation of mercy and grace
concludes with language equally encouraging:&mdash;'And the Spirit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And
let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the
water of life freely' (Rev. xxii. 17). Why then should you doubt?
Why should you pause? Why should you continue to linger around
the promises of salvation, and not embrace them as the source of
your comfort?"</p>

<p>"I do not hesitate to plead the promise of salvation from any
doubt of its necessity, or of its truthfulness. I feel, however, such
a burden of guilt on my conscience, for having uttered so many hard
things against the Redeemer and his great salvation, and feel so
oppressed by a sense of unparalleled unworthiness, that I seem more
inclined to endure the chastening of the Lord, than venture to
implore the exercise of his pardoning love and mercy."</p>

<p>"You are, it is true, unworthy, but not unwelcome; unworthy,
but not unfit: for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'All the fitness he requireth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to <em>feel</em> your need of him.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="noind">How simple! Believe, and be saved; come to me, and I will give
you rest."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, the plan of salvation is both simple and suited; but
these attributes of its character stagger and perplex me."</p>

<p>"How so, Madam?"</p>

<p>"It appears more consonant to the awful majesty of Divine justice
to demand from me some costly sacrifice&mdash;to call upon me to
endure some severe privations and sufferings, as the condition of
pardon and acceptance, rather than to offer them freely and gratuitously.
I ought, I think, to suffer some extreme and prolonged infliction,
before I ought to cherish a hope of salvation."</p>

<p>"That is true; but, as the apostle says, 'By grace are ye saved
through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God; not
of works, lest any man should boast' (Eph. ii. 8, 9)."</p>

<p>"I feel thankful that I am not now what I was yesterday&mdash;a proud
and haughty sceptic; looking with scornful contempt on the Bible&mdash;on
the Sabbath, and its public services&mdash;and on all who make a profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of love to Jesus Christ; but I dare not lay claim to the
spiritual blessings which God graciously bestows on his redeemed
and renovated people. I hope in his mercy, and pray for its manifestations
to my guilty conscience, but I cannot do more; indeed, at
times, I tremble while cherishing a hope in his mercy, lest I should
add the sin of presumption, to the many other sins I have committed
against him."</p>

<p>We now closed the interview by reading the Scriptures and prayer;
and then returned, devoutly thankful to the God of salvation for
what we had seen and heard.</p>

<p>In this state of agitating uncertainty, as to the final issue of her
hopes and her fears, Mrs. Farrington continued, as Mr. Annesley
afterwards informed me, for several months, suffering at times intense
remorse, and often strongly tempted to abandon herself to despair.
But by a patient continuance in the study of the Bible and listening
to the ministry of the Word, in meditation and in prayer, she
felt in process of time the sacred power of the promise of mercy
and grace; tasted that the Lord is gracious, and eventually had
hope and peace in believing; living through life in the fear of God,
and giving a practical exemplification of the truth of the apostolic
declaration, that "the grace of God that bringeth salvation, teaching
us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for
that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and
our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
zealous of good works" (Titus ii. 11-14).</p>

<p>The conversion of this lady to the Christian faith, after having
signalized herself for many years by her unceasing hostility to it, is
a very strong evidence in confirmation of its Divine origin. What
human power could have effected such a moral renovation as that
which was produced while she was listening to this sermon by Mr.
Annesley? She anticipated no such a change, nor did she desire it.
In the sermon, which curiosity prompted her to hear, there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
concentration of argument to carry conviction to her judgment&mdash;no
outbursts of eloquence&mdash;nor any decorations of style, to impress her
feelings or attract her taste, but merely an interrogation, and that
one of the most simple. From whence, then, came the all-powerful
energy by which her haughty spirit was made to quail before the
truth, which she had so long stigmatized as a cunningly devised
fable? Whence, unless from Him who can easily subdue all things
to himself; and whose spiritual triumphs are often graced by the
spontaneous submission of his most malignant enemies; thus turning
a prophetic announcement into an historic fact&mdash;"Thy people
shall be willing in the day of thy power."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A PARTY AT THE ELMS.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_319.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I  must now request the courteous reader to return
with me to Mr. Holmes and his family, at the Elms,
where, as it will be recollected, we left Louisa, the
eldest daughter, in a state of great mental perplexity,
though somewhat soothed by the judicious letter of her worthy
friend Mrs. Loader. It will also be remembered that Louisa had
addressed a second letter to the latter, detailing further her career
of Christian experience, and asking additional advice and assistance
as to her future course.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
</div>

<p>According to annual custom, a large party dined at the Elms,
consisting principally of Mr. Holmes' old city friends, who came
to enjoy a day in the country, and have a talk over the events
of former times. They had all sprung from an obscure origin&mdash;had
commenced to push their fortunes in London about the same time&mdash;and
were now in the possession of considerable wealth. The party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
dined early. When the cloth was removed, the worthy host said
he would give a toast, which he hoped the ladies would respond to
as well as the gentlemen, though he admitted he ought to apologize
for attempting to revive a practice which was now becoming obsolete&mdash;"Prosperity
to the citizens of London; and may they ever express
their gratitude to God, by supporting the institutions of benevolence."
This toast having been duly honoured, the ladies withdrew,
leaving the gentlemen to their debates and discussions.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes proposed a walk&mdash;a proposal which the ladies and
young people gladly fell in with. It was a fine tranquil evening, at
the close of one of those beautiful days which frequently occur in
this country in the month of October. The sun was sinking in a
sea of crimson and gold, behind a finely wooded hill to the west, and
throwing his rich amber light through the foliage of the pleasure
ground in which the party was now sauntering. Everything tended
to soothe and tranquillize the mind, while not a sound could be
heard, but the rustling of the autumn leaves beneath the feet, or
their fall as the branches vibrated in the almost imperceptible evening
breeze.</p>

<p>Among the young people composing the party that day at the
Elms, was Miss Martin, an intimate friend of Miss Holmes, and decidedly
religious, but between whom and Louisa there had hitherto
been but little sympathy on this subject. Without possessing the
years and experience of Mrs. Loader, she nevertheless possessed an
affectionate disposition, with a fund of sterling good sense, and was
thus well qualified to impart consolation to the agitated and distressed
mind of her friend. Louisa felt her heart gradually lightened
as she conversed with Miss Martin; and the two ladies, walking
on together a little in advance, got engaged in so interesting a discussion,
that they soon lost sight of the younger members of the
party, who had set off to amuse themselves in another direction.
Louisa now recollected that she had promised a Bible the day before
to an old woman in the neighbourhood, and invited Miss Martin
to accompany her with it there&mdash;a proposal to which her friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
gladly acceded. They accordingly proceeded down a narrow path
which led from the shrubbery to a retired country road. They then
walked along a short distance till they came to a neat cottage, at
the door of which they gently tapped. It was opened by the old
woman, Mrs. Kent, who invited them to walk in and sit down.
They readily consented, and spent there a most interesting hour.</p>

<p>"I feel deeply obliged, ladies," said Mrs. Kent, "by your kindness
in fetching me this Bible. It is indeed a treasure. A large printed
Bible like this is just what I have long been wishing to procure, as
my eyes are become so dim I cannot see to read this small print"
(exhibiting a Bible which bore the marks of age).</p>

<p>"I am very glad, indeed, that you are pleased with it," replied
Louisa, "and I trust you may long be spared in health to enjoy its
stores."</p>

<p>"I have great reason to be thankful to God for the health he has
given me. I am in his hand&mdash;he doeth all things well."</p>

<p>"You have really a pretty cottage here," said Miss Martin, "and
it is very tastefully adorned. Have you lived here many years?"</p>

<p>"About twenty years. I was turned out of the cottage I lived in
before, by Lord Harwood's steward, because I would not give up my
religion; but the Lord opened the heart of a good man who lives in
the village, and he built this little cottage for me, and I have lived
here rent free ever since."</p>

<p>"How long may it be since you first knew the Lord?"</p>

<p>"More than forty years. I was, when young, a very thoughtless
girl, and took great delight in vain pleasures; but the Lord was
pleased, blessed be his name, to call me to a knowledge of the truth,
and to love and serve him, when I was about your age."</p>

<p>"And you are not weary of his service?"</p>

<p>"Weary of his service!" said the venerable matron, her eyes
sparkling as with youthful ardour&mdash;"no, Miss, though I often wonder
that the Lord is not weary of me, as I am such an unprofitable
servant."</p>

<p>"Then after forty years' experience, you can bear testimony to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
truth of what Solomon says of religion: 'Her ways are ways of
pleasantness, and all her paths are peace?'"</p>

<p>Vol. ii. p. 299.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"That I can. I have been a widow five and twenty years. I
have outlived all my children but one, and I have not seen him for
more than sixteen years. I have had many troubles, but the Lord
has brought me through them all. He has given me a spirit of resignation
and contentment, and I can say, Let him do with me as
seemeth good in his sight. He is too wise to err."</p>

<p>"Then you don't envy the rich and the noble?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss, I envy no one. If the rich have comforts that I have
not, they have cares and temptations, from which I am protected.
May the Lord incline you, my young friends, to seek him in your
youth, and then you will find a treasure which is of more value than
thousands of gold and silver."</p>

<p>"I hope he has inclined us to seek him," said Miss Holmes; "and
as you have known him so many years, I shall be happy to come
and visit you, that you may teach me the way of the Lord more perfectly."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to see you at any time, if you will condescend to
come and see me; but it is not in my power to teach you. The
prophet says, 'All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and
great shall be the peace of thy children.'"</p>

<p>"I will soon come back again and have a long chat. Good
night."</p>

<p>"Good night, ladies. May the Lord bless you."</p>

<p>"She is a dear old woman," said Miss Martin. "I have quite
fallen in love with her."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Mary, she is one of the Lord's hidden jewels, set
apart for himself. I am very glad to have made her acquaintance,
but I confess that I neglected to do this till the other day, though I
had often seen her knitting on the seat in front of her cottage as I
passed by."</p>

<p>The two friends now re-entered the avenue, and, taking a by-path,
ascended a little rising ground, which commanded a fine view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
surrounding country. "How delightful it is, Louisa," said Miss
Martin, "to get a day's excursion away from the bustle and smoke
of London. What a beautiful landscape you have here&mdash;that venerable
church tower rising in the distance among the trees, and that
fine old mansion at the foot of the hill, with the deer feeding in the
park in front; and see what a pretty object Mrs. Kent's cottage
makes, when seen through this vista in the trees."</p>

<p>"It is certainly a beautiful prospect, Mary. I often come here to
contemplate it. I made a sketch the other day of Mrs. Kent's cottage,
which I shall show you when we get into the house. It is both
a picturesque object when viewed from a distance, and loses none of
its attractions on a near approach. She has displayed great taste in
the way she has disposed the evergreens and flowers around it. But
its chief glory is within."</p>

<p>"Very true, my dear Louisa. It is a sacred spot&mdash;often visited by
unseen messengers, when they come to earth on errands of mercy.
Strangers would pass by, and admire only the neatness of its external
appearance, but we have seen its concealed beauties."</p>

<p>"I was quite delighted," said Miss Holmes, "with the first visit
I paid her. She certainly possesses a very cultivated mind for a
person in her station. She has been a great reader in her time,
but now her favourite study is divinity, and the Bible is her text-book.
She gave me some particulars of her history. Her life has
been a chequered one. I was quite taken with the artless simplicity
of her conversation, and with the ease, I may almost say elegance, of
her manners. I shall certainly often stroll to her cottage for a chat;
and you must come here again soon, and pay her another visit along
with me."</p>

<p>"I am glad, my dear, that you are partial to her," replied Miss
Martin. I shall be delighted to accompany you again to Mrs.
Kent's. I hope you will often visit her. You will derive, I have
no doubt, much spiritual benefit from her conversation. There is
nothing which so polishes and refines the character as the influence
of religion. It improves the taste, without making it fastidious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
enlarges the intellect, without engendering vanity; softens and
sweetens the temper; and inspires a consciousness of individual
worth and importance, while at the same time it pays a respectful
regard to the laws and customs which prevail in society. Hence
a Christian appears as dignified in a cottage as in a mansion; and
living comparatively disengaged from the temptations of the world,
he is more at liberty to commune with the Redeemer, by which he
imperceptibly receives a more perfect impression of his image."</p>

<p>"But do you think, Mary, that every Christian exemplifies the
correctness of your remarks?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear. Some do not feel the influence of religion till late
in life, when their taste has been vitiated, their habits formed, and
their tempers set; and though it will correct some of the evils
which they may have contracted, yet it rarely happens that their
character receives such an amount of refinement as it would have
done, had they felt its transforming power at an earlier period."</p>

<p>Just at this moment they were startled by a deep groan, that
came from the wood near which they were standing, and on running
to afford some assistance to the supposed sufferer, Miss Holmes
beheld her facetious sister Emma, with a group of young friends,
attempting to conceal themselves, but who burst out into loud
laughter when they were discovered.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, girls?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, ladies; O nothing!" said Lucy Cooper, with a suppressed
smile.</p>

<p>"We were afraid, from the groan we heard, that some one had
been hurt, or was suddenly taken ill."</p>

<p>"It was only Emma, feigning illness, to disturb you in your grave
musings."</p>

<p>"O! Emma, I wonder how you could be so foolish! I am glad,
however, that there is nothing the matter; and I do not regret having
been disturbed, as it appears to have contributed to your mirth."</p>

<p>"We have just been seeing Mrs. Kent," said Emma, "and she told
us that you, and I suppose Miss Martin, had been there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"O what a lovely place!" exclaimed several voices.</p>

<p>"How I should like to live in that beautiful cottage!" said a little
girl; "I wish grandpapa would buy such a one for me."</p>

<p>"The old lady," said another, "was looking over the Bible you
gave her when we tapped at the door, and she rose and received us
with as much grace and ease as though she had been a duchess.
She appears to be a very contented, nice old woman, and seems to
be very religious in her way. Is she not, Emma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is."</p>

<p>"Aye, she is at a good age to become religious, and she has nothing
else to engage her attention. I should like to have another
talk with her."</p>

<p>"We shall be happy to see you, Lucy, at any time," said Miss
Holmes; "and I think both you and Emma would be all the better
for a few lessons of staidness and sobriety from Mrs. Kent."</p>

<p>"O yes, I know I should; but as my propensity is to be religious,
I must check it, or I shall get quite unhappy. It won't do for me
to associate much with such devout people. I shall be sure to catch
the infection, from my natural habit of imitation."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes would have made some reply, but the appearance of
her brothers, and some of the gentlemen from the house, put a stop
to further conversation.</p>

<p>"Come, ladies," one of them exclaimed, "where have you been
rambling to all this time? We thought we had lost you. You have
forgotten how late it is, and we must be off for town in an hour or
two."</p>

<p>The youthful party, thus summoned, hastened to the house, where,
after partaking of tea, the guests prepared to depart, just as the
moon began to rise. The family then being left alone, drew their
seats round the fire for a few minutes before they retired to rest, and
began to talk over the incidents of the day.</p>

<p>"This has been a very happy day," said Mr. Holmes; "for though
our friends are not all religious people, yet they are very worthy, excellent
persons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be a high gratification to you, father," said his eldest
son, "to see the companions of your youth sitting around your
table, with your children, and, by mutual intercourse, recalling the
early scenes and incidents of your career."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is, William; and I hope God has reserved the same
enjoyment for you all; and that, when I am resting in the grave with
my fathers, you will think and talk of these gone-by times."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days after this, Miss Holmes received the following letter
from her esteemed friend, Mrs. Loader, which she had been anxiously
expecting for some time:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig"><em>29th Oct., 18&mdash;.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Louisa</span>,&mdash;I received your letter of &mdash;&mdash;, and was
glad to find that you were so far restored as to be able to occupy
yourself in the service of Christian benevolence. The duties
which now devolve upon you are no less novel than they are important;
and while you may provoke others to scorn by the activity
of your zeal, you may sometimes likewise involve yourself in perplexity
and mortification. You already begin to feel the loss of the
spiritual enjoyments which you so largely participated in when
"first you knew the Lord," and you suppose that this is a conclusive
evidence of the declining influence of religious principle over
your mind; but you ought not to draw such a conclusion. If, dear
Louisa, you expect that the realities of the unseen world will always
retain that ascendency over your affections which they acquired
when you first felt their power, you proceed in your calculations on
mistaken data. When you were first impressed by the truth, you
were a prisoner&mdash;confined in the solitary chamber; you held but
little intercourse with the world around you, and your feelings were
rendered more susceptible of strong excitement, from the influence
which a protracted affliction had imperceptibly acquired over them;
but now you are out and abroad&mdash;your spirits are braced up by the
pressure of calls and engagements, which demand your attention;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and you are compelled to engage in the duties and pursuits of social
life. Can such a change in your habits take place without having
some powerful effect on the state of your affections? Impossible!
An active life is less favourable to devotional feeling than a contemplative
one; and though I would not throw out a remark which
should operate as a discouragement to exertion in the cause of Him
who became obedient unto death for us, yet I assure you, that in
proportion as the number of your employments increase, you will be
deprived of the pleasures of retired devotion, even though the truths
of religion retain their ascendency over your judgment, and its holy
principles reign in your heart.</p>

<p>"I have thought it right to make these observations, to guard you
against the common error into which young Christians often fall,
in supposing that their faith is not genuine, because it does not
uniformly act with the same degree of activity and power.</p>

<p>"That you should, at times, admit the possibility of the entire
passing away of your religious convictions and impressions, and
should look forward with shuddering dread to the consequences and
final issue of such a calamitous event, does not surprise me, neither
does it give me any alarm. This is usually one of the earliest mental
trials a young disciple has to endure. You say that, notwithstanding
the ceaseless terror which agitates your heart, you are
moving forward, though slowly, between hope and fear: and if so,
you are safe in the right way to the city of habitation, as fear will
keep you from presumption, and hope from despair. Yes, my dear
Louisa, the harmonious blending of these affections of the soul, will
ever prove, in their restraining and sustaining influence, a shield of
defence against the subtle temptations of the great adversary, and
a well-spring of consolation in the season of gloom and depression.
We read, 'The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those
that hope in his mercy' (Psal. cxlvii. 11). But you are unconsciously
guilty of a capital error&mdash;you think, and feel, and write, as if there
were no being in existence who is able to keep you from falling, and
who, at the same time, has no personal interest in doing it. Has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
a father no personal interest in the preservation of the life and
happiness of his child? Hear what your heavenly Father says, when
speaking to you from the celestial glory&mdash;'Can a woman forget her
sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her
womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I
have graven thee upon the palms of my hands' (Isa. xlix. 15, 16).
Can you suppose that Jesus Christ, after dying to redeem you, will
abandon you and leave you to perish, when you are praying&mdash;'Lord
save me!' He loves his own; and all who come to him to be saved
are his own, and none else will come; and when they come, he
will in no wise neglect them or cast them out. Meditate often on
the following words, which he spoke when on earth to his disciples,
and which he has had recorded in the sacred volume, for the
consolation of his disciples of all future times&mdash;'I pray not that
thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest
keep them from the evil' (John xvii. 15). You may have great and
sore trials in your Christian course&mdash;you may be exposed to severe
temptations and great moral dangers, but you are safe; <span class="smcap">He</span> will
not overlook you, or leave you, who gave his life as a ransom for
your redemption. Your final salvation depends on no doubtful contingency.
It is fixed and certain. And <span class="smcap">He</span> who gave his life for
you, is now preparing a place for you in heaven&mdash;is doing something
in your behalf which implies the exercise of power&mdash;getting in readiness,
as I heard an eloquent preacher remark the other Sabbath, a
quiet chamber for the accommodation of his beloved disciple in the
house of his Father. And after preparing this mansion, he will not
suffer its intended occupant to perish by the way. No; 'My sheep
hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give
unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall
any man pluck them out of my hand.' (John x. 27, 28).</p>

<p>"I am happy that you are intimate with the Corries, who used to
be our next-door neighbours when we lived in London. They are a
very excellent family, decidedly pious, and very benevolent. They
are Christians of the old school&mdash;still retain their attachment to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
singular phraseology which at one time was much in vogue amongst
our evangelical preachers&mdash;and have imbibed a few opinions which,
I think, need revision.</p>

<p>"You appear to have had your peace disturbed, and your cheering
prospects darkened, by your intercourse with them; but be not
alarmed, as the more your faith is tried, the stronger it will grow;
and instead of sustaining any injury from the conflicting elements
of doubt and suspicion, which threaten to tear it up by the roots, it
will strike them still deeper and deeper in that holy soil, in which
it is ordained to flourish.</p>

<p>"Your friends are not singular in their views of the nature of
faith, but I do not think that they are correct; and as you have
requested me to give you my opinion, I will cheerfully do so. They
confound a plenary conviction of the truth of the Christian scheme
of salvation, with an assurance of a personal interest in its invaluable
blessings. This is the error into which they have fallen, and
on the eve of which you are now standing; but it does not require
much force of reasoning to show its fallacy. Faith is an assent of
the mind to some truth, or some system of truth, which is established
by satisfactory evidence. As this assent becomes weaker or stronger,
in proportion to the clearness and force of the evidence by which it
is produced, a full assurance of faith is that high degree of it which
admits of no suspicion. Hence, you are convinced that Jesus Christ
came into this world&mdash;that he sojourned in the land of Judea&mdash;that
he performed the miracles which are ascribed to him&mdash;that he died
on the cross to expiate the guilt of sin&mdash;rose from the dead&mdash;and is
now seated on the right hand of the majesty on high, receiving there
the ascriptions of praise from the lips of the redeemed.</p>

<p>"You want no miracle wrought in your presence to induce you to
believe this, because you believe it on the testimony of the inspired
writers; nor is it necessary that a voice should speak to you from
the celestial glory to confirm it. But though you are fully convinced
of these facts, yet you are not so fully convinced that he died <em>for you</em>&mdash;or
that he is gone to heaven to prepare a mansion for you, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
house of his Father. You believe that there is 'redemption through
his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
grace;' but you sometimes doubt whether <em>you</em> are redeemed and forgiven.
You believe that 'he is able to save them to the uttermost
that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
for them;' but you are not fully persuaded that he is interceding
for you. You feel your need of such a Saviour; and you know
that 'all that the Father giveth him shall come to him;' yet you
doubt whether the Father ever gave you to Christ, or whether you
have ever come unto him in a scriptural manner. You cannot believe
the truth of the gospel more firmly than you do believe it&mdash;you
cannot place a more entire dependence on Christ for salvation
than you do place&mdash;you cannot feel more disposed to give him all
the honour of your salvation than you do feel; and yet, at times,
you doubt your acceptance&mdash;your safety&mdash;and your final blessedness.
Does not this clearly prove that faith in Christ, and an assurance
of an interest in him, are essentially distinct?</p>

<p>"Nor can we doubt the correctness of this assertion, if we attend
to the order of the Spirit's operations on our mind. He inclines us
to believe the truth which he exhibits; and he enables us to do it.
'For he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear,
that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall
glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you;
all things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he
shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.' This is his <em>first</em>
act; but it is a <em>later</em> act, to bear testimony with our spirit that we
are born of God; and as some space of time must necessarily elapse
after he has performed the first act, before he performs the second,
it is evident that faith may exist in its purity, and in its power,
even when there is no assurance of it. Hence it follows, that a
person who relies on the atonement of Christ for salvation is as safe,
though he live and die without any firm persuasion of his future
blessedness, as one who is enabled to rejoice in hope of the glory of
God. Indeed, my dear Louisa, I should tremble to make the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
happiness of my soul depend, in the slightest degree, on my personal
assurance of its safety. This would be nothing less than intermingling
a personal attainment with the efficacy of the Saviour's death;
and placing my hope of a blissful immortality on the precarious basis
of a fluctuating feeling, rather than on that immoveable foundation
which God has laid in Zion. If you peruse the biographies of some
of the most eminent Christians, you will perceive that during their
pilgrimage on earth, they frequently complained of that alternation of
feeling which you now experience; and some have been left for days,
and for months, to walk in mental darkness without the light of the
Divine countenance. Your favourite poet, Cowper, was a man eminently
embued with the spirit of Christ; and yet in what a dark and
gloomy frame of mind did he leave this world. His biographer says,
that within a few days of his decease, after a near relative had been
attempting to cheer him with the prospect of exchanging a world of
infirmity and sorrow, for a far more exceeding and eternal weight
of glory, he threw from him the words of peace, and exclaimed,
'Oh, spare me! spare me! You know, you <em>know</em> it to be false.'
Having given utterance to this despairing language, he sunk into a
state of apparent insensibility, in which state he continued for twelve
hours, and then expired without moving a limb, or even uttering a
moan. Thus terminated the mortal career of one of the greatest
poets that ever consecrated the powers of his mind to the cause of
Christ: entering death's dark vale without a ray of light to cheer
him in his lonely passage.</p>

<p>"But shall we say that he died without faith, because he died
without an assurance that he possessed it? Would not such an
opinion necessarily tend to destroy our confidence in the sufficiency
of the atonement of Christ, by making our final happiness depend
on the peculiar frame of our mind in that solemn hour, when some
latent physical cause may bring over the spirit a gloom which no
human effort can dispel? If we <em>trust</em> in Christ, we shall be saved;
and though we may sometimes doubt the genuine nature of our act
of faith, yet that circumstance will not endanger either our present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
safety or our future blessedness. Indeed, I have known some most
exemplary Christians, who have trembled to speak with confidence
of attaining the recompense of reward. Removed at an equal distance
from the dread of perishing and an <em>assurance</em> of being saved,
they have been enabled to cherish and display those dispositions
and principles which have satisfied their judgment of their safety,
without affording an entire relief to all their anxieties.</p>

<p>"But though, my dear Louisa, an assurance of your interest in
Christ is not essential to your salvation, yet it is essential to your
happiness. You cannot doubt it, without feeling a deep pang; and
if you should habitually doubt it, you will live in a state of perpetual
dejection. I urge you, then, to attain it in the spring-time
of your experience; or you may accustom yourself to feel more
inclined to cherish, than to expel despondency. 'Wherefore,' says
the apostle, 'give all diligence to make your calling and election
sure.' And that you may attain this assurance of hope, which will
be as an anchor of the soul during the perils and conflicts of time,
look up, by faith and prayer, to the invisible Source of all consolation
and joy; ever remembering that 'the Spirit itself beareth witness
with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children,
then heirs; heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ' (Rom.
viii. 16, 17). This witnessing testimony is as necessary to superinduce
this assurance, as the precious blood of Christ is necessary to
remove the guilt of sin. Never forget this.</p>

<p>"And if you should not immediately attain a full assurance of
your interest in Christ, do not suffer your mind to be overwhelmed
with anxiety; as this is an attainment which belongs to the more
advanced Christian, rather than to the young disciple. It will not
come at once by an overpowering force, driving away every gloomy
fear, and throwing open before you a clear prospect of a blissful
immortality, but gradually, at intermitting seasons, weakening the
strength of your doubts, and strengthening the weakness of your
faith; till at length the God of hope will fill you with all joy and
peace in believing. I was much struck with a paragraph in a devotional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
treatise which I recently perused, and which I here quote&mdash;'Great
consolation is often received at different seasons, even during
the period when our general feelings are intermingled with dark
and painful forebodings. Hence, the weakest believer sometimes returns
from the closet, and from the sanctuary, strong in faith, though
he may again relapse into his more stated frame of despondency.
The clouds occasionally separate, to enable him to view the Sun of
Righteousness, and feel the healing virtue of his presence, though
they may again unite to obscure his vision, and leave him to grope
on his 'darkling way.' These intermitting seasons of darkness and
light, of high enjoyment and deep dejection, have a salutary effect,
and serve to prepare him for that state of settled assurance, which,
in fact, they tend in some measure to produce.'</p>

<p>"As I have so far exceeded the ordinary bounds of a letter, I shall
not enter on the other very important questions to which you refer
in your last; but will do it at some future period. It gives us great
pleasure to hear that you have such an excellent minister near you,
and though he preaches in a chapel which does not belong to our
Establishment, yet, if he preach Christ and him crucified, I have no
doubt you will enjoy his labours. The feet of the messenger that
publisheth peace, are no less beautiful on the mountains, than in the
city; and his proclamation is as interesting to the self-condemned
sinner, when delivered in the unconsecrated chapel, as in the majestic
cathedral; and though we may retain our partialities to forms and
places, yet, if we ever suffer our prejudices to deprive us of our
spiritual privileges, we shall be guilty of a suicidal act against both
our peace and steadfastness in the faith.</p>

<p>"The account which you have given me of your sisters has awakened
an opposite class of feelings in my breast. Emma, I fear, is
under some fatal influence which you have not yet detected, and will,
unless subdued by the loving-kindness of God our Saviour, devote
herself to the pleasures of the world. Her beauty has made her
vain, and the versatility of her talents is a snare to her. You must
watch over her with great care, and pray that He who called <em>you</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
out of darkness into his marvellous light, would be pleased to renew
her in the spirit of her mind. Jane is a lovely girl. She has an
elegant mind, and if the good work is begun in her heart, she will
be an interesting companion to you. Let me hear from you as soon
as you can spare a few moments from your numerous engagements,
and believe me, yours affectionately,</p>

<h2>FAMILY SKETCHES.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_336.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">I n a large family we often find that some of the children
discover a peculiar aversion to the religious habits
which prevail amongst them. Though the primary
cause of this hostility may be traced up to the depravity
of our nature, yet we ought not to overlook the secondary
causes which may have contributed to its growth and manifestation.
For though there is an innate propensity to evil in the heart, and
though that propensity is much stronger in some than in others,
yet it rarely breaks through the barriers which a judicious course
of instruction throws up, unless it is brought into contact with
strong temptations, which <em>might</em> have been guarded against. Hence
most pious parents, when mourning over the impiety of their children,
have to reproach themselves for some omissions or compliances
which have directly or indirectly tended to produce the evil,
and which very naturally lead to a fatal indifference or open hostility
to the claims of religion, which no subsequent remonstrances are able
to correct or control.</p>
</div>

<p>This was the case in the family of the Holmes. Miss Emma was
a beautiful girl. Her manners were exceedingly graceful. She
was witty and satirical in her disposition, and from her childhood
gave unequivocal proofs that she required more than ordinary attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
in the cultivation of her mind and the formation of her character.
From the superior vivacity of her spirits, the playfulness of
her fancy, and her intellectual acuteness, she gained a powerful
ascendency over the affections of her parents, who, trusting too
much to the maturity of her judgment for the correction of budding
ills, paid less regard to the formation of her habits than they had
done with their other children. The partiality for dress, which she
discovered when a child, increased as she grew up, till at length she
lavished nearly the whole of her attention on her external appearance.
After having spent a few years in the establishment where
her elder sisters had finished their education, she was sent, at the
age of sixteen, to a fashionable boarding-school, in which too much
attention was paid to mere personal graces and accomplishments. It
was here that she formed an intimacy with the daughter of Colonel
Orme, who resided near the Elms, and which proved a source of
poignant sorrow to all the members of her family. After leaving
school, she was permitted by her unsuspecting parents to exchange
visits with her young friend, who was, by the influence of her sentiments
and example, gradually destroying that reverence for the authority
of religion, and that attachment to its practices, which they
were so anxious to cherish and to strengthen. Miss Holmes saw
with deep regret the fatal bias which her sister's mind was receiving;
and though she availed herself of every opportunity which circumstances
offered to check and subdue it, yet she constantly met
with determined resistance.</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Emma, after her sister had been urging her to return
some novels which her friend had sent for her perusal, "I shall
not do it till I have read them. They are amusing and interesting;
and if they contain any objectionable sentiments, I can easily reject
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, they may amuse and may interest, but they will not improve
your mind. They will give you false views of nature and the
world&mdash;imperceptibly reconcile you to sentiments and opinions at
which you would now shudder&mdash;induce such a love for the marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and romantic that you will be dissatisfied with the dull uniformity
of life, and destroy all the religious impressions which our dear
parents have been so anxious to produce."</p>

<p>"When I feel the injury to which you allude I will give them up,
but till then you must permit me to follow my own inclination without
control. I am old enough to judge for myself."</p>

<p>Whether the varieties which are apparent in the human character
are to be traced up to the different methods employed in its formation,
or to some inherent peculiarity in the constitution of the
mind, is a much vexed question amongst philosophers. Education
and example no doubt exercise a most material influence, but they
do not operate in a uniform manner, as we have known the most
opposite characters rise out of the same family. To account for this,
unless on the principle that there is some inherent propensity in
our nature, which gives to each person an individuality of character,
would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, as we should naturally
expect a uniformity of result where the same means are
taken to secure it, unless there be some latent cause by which this
is prevented. Hence some of the most improved systems of education
make provision for a difference in the style of instruction, and
in the mode of treatment, to accord with the natural temper and inclination
of the pupil; supposing, that by such a judicious arrangement,
his moral and intellectual improvement may be more effectually
advanced.</p>

<p>But how often does even this method fail of accomplishing its
intended effect; as we see the children of a large family discovering
a diversity in their taste&mdash;their disposition&mdash;and their habits&mdash;no
less striking than they would have done, if no wisdom or discretion
had been employed in their cultivation. Meekness and irritability&mdash;an
affable demeanour, and a proud hauteur&mdash;a placidness and
tenderness of disposition, and a violence and resentment of spirit&mdash;a
love of display, and a native modesty which withdraws from
public notice&mdash;a passion for some individual pursuit, and a restlessness
which no object can fix&mdash;are the moral lights and shadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
which often fall on the members of the same family, giving that
variety of hue and tinge which we discover in the aspect of the natural
world.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, in their plan of domestic government, endeavoured
to do three things&mdash;to attach their children to their own
home; to encourage them to repose unlimited confidence in their
parents; and to train them to cultivate pure and ardent love for
each other. By the adoption of these maxims, they displayed their
good sense and parental regard; as it is uniformly found, that when
a child outgrows his love for his father's house, he has lost the sheet-anchor
of his safety; that if he have not free and unrestricted access
to his parents, he will become suspicious of, and estranged from them;
and that if he feel no peculiar pleasure in the society and interest
in the welfare of the other branches of the family, he will cherish a
jealous and envious disposition, not more destructive of their happiness
than of his own.</p>

<p>When speaking of the excellencies which so finely budded on the
opening character of some of their children, they often expressed
their regret at the unpromising appearances of others; yet indulged
the hope that they would outgrow their "flaws unseemly," and
ultimately display, not only the strength of reason, but the beauty
of virtue. As they advanced from childhood to youth, and from
youth to riper years, they gradually developed the peculiarities of
their tempers and dispositions, which were so dissimilar, that no
uniform mode of discipline could be adopted with any chance of
proving beneficial. Mr. Holmes was too much occupied in his commercial
affairs, to pay any great attention to his children while they
were young, and, therefore, the chief responsibility of their education
devolved on their mother, who, feeling anxious to discharge the trust
reposed in her, availed herself of all the information which she could
acquire. The following paragraph, which she met with in a favourite
author, gave her an insight into the art of a judicious management.
It inspired her with a good hope respecting those who appeared
the most unpromising, because the most untractable:&mdash;"A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
discriminating teacher will appreciate the individual character of
each pupil, in order to appropriate her management. We must
strengthen the feeble, while we repel the bold. We cannot educate
by a <em>receipt</em>: for after studying the best rules, and after digesting
them into the best system, much must depend on contingent circumstances;
for that which is good may be inapplicable. The cultivator
of the human mind must, like the gardener, study diversities of soil,
or he may plant diligently, and water faithfully, with little fruit.
The skilful labourer knows that, even when the surface is not particularly
promising, there is often a rough, strong ground, which
will amply repay the trouble of breaking it up; yet we are often
most taken with a soft surface, though it conceal a shallow depth,
because it promises present reward and little trouble. But strong
and pertinacious tempers, of which, perhaps, obstinacy is the leading
vice, under skilful management, often turn out steady and sterling
characters; while, from softer clay, a firm and vigorous virtue is but
seldom produced. Pertinacity is often principle, which wants nothing
but to be led to its true object; while the uniformly yielding,
and universally accommodating spirit, is not seldom the result of a
feeble tone of morals, of a temper eager for praise, and acting for
reward."</p>

<p>It is often remarked, that children are men and women in miniature;
and as they grow up to their full stature, we often see them
exhibiting, in broader and more palpable development, the excellencies
and defects of their juvenile character; but when they are
subjected to the operation of extraordinary causes, they sometimes
undergo an entire transformation, and become new creatures. The
most hopeless turn out the most valuable&mdash;those who have inflicted
the most pungent sorrow ultimately become the source of the purest
delight&mdash;the prematurely promising have faded in the spring-time
vigour of their virtue&mdash;and those who have been endowed with the
greatest talents have brought down the gray hairs of their parents
with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p>The eldest sons of this family, William and Edward, who succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
to the business when the father retired, had turned out everything
their parents could wish, but presented no prominent traits
of character, beyond that of well-conducted, pious young men. The
youngest son, John, who was devoted to the medical profession, possessed
more adroitness and vivacity than his brothers; but either
from the laxity of parental control, or the peculiar connections which
his pursuits in life led him to form, he disappointed the high expectations
which he had raised, and eventually became the source of
domestic grief. He was greatly attached to his sister Emma, whom
he most nearly resembled, not only in person, but in disposition;
and having imbibed sceptical notions on religious subjects, soon after
he commenced his professional studies, he infused them into her
mind, and thus did her great injury. There was an unobtrusive
modesty about Jane, which naturally induced her to retire from
public notice, and rendered her fully appreciated only by her more
intimate friends; while Emma's good qualities were unfortunately,
to a great extent, obscured by her inordinate vanity and desire of
admiration. The love of dress, as already mentioned, early took
possession of her mind, and her parents injudiciously nourished this
passion, by allowing her to do as she pleased in this respect, not
conceiving that by such a compliance she would sustain any moral
injury. But they lived to see and deplore their error.</p>

<p>"It is a just remark," says an excellent writer, "that objects in
their own nature innocent, and entitled to notice, may become the
sources of disadvantage and of guilt; when, being raised from the
rank of trifles to ideal importance, they occupy a share of attention
which they do not deserve; and then they are pursued with an
immoderate ardour, which at once indisposes the mind to occupations
of higher concern, and clouds it with malignant emotions."
Perhaps there is no subject which will more strikingly illustrate the
correctness of this remark, than that passion for fashionable attire
by which some are enslaved. "If, in addition to that reasonable
degree of regard to propriety of dress, which insures the strictest
neatness, and a modest conformity, in unobjectionable points, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
authority of custom, a young woman permits her thoughts to be
frequently engaged by the subject of exterior ornaments, occupations
of moment will be proportionably neglected. From the complacency
natural to all human beings, when employed in contemplating objects
by means of which the flattering hope of shining is presented to
them, she will be in the most imminent danger of contracting a
distaste to serious reflection, and of being at length absorbed in the
delusions of vanity and self-love. It is, undoubtedly, a matter of
indifference, whether a lady's ribands be green or blue; whether her
head be decorated with flowers or with feathers; whether her gown
be composed of muslin or of silk. But it is no matter of indifference,
whether the time which she devotes to the determination of any of
these points is to be reckoned by hours or by minutes; or whether,
on discovering the elevation of her bonnet to be an inch higher or
lower, and its tint a shade lighter or darker, than the model which
prevails among her acquaintance, she is overwhelmed with consternation
and disappointment, or bears the calamity with the apathy of a
stoic."</p>

<p>The love of dress, like every other improper affection, has a material
influence over the formation of the character; and though it
operates by a silent process, yet it is invariably found to have a pernicious
tendency. It induces habits of expenditure, which are often
beyond the resources of the individual; saps the foundation of morals,
and involves in inextricable difficulties. Bills are left unpaid, and
every excuse and apology which ingenuity and artifice can devise, is
employed to silence the remonstrances of the creditor&mdash;whom the
debtor avoids with an instinctive dread, no less sensitive than the
child does the place supposed to be haunted by an evil spirit.</p>

<p>But, if the resources are sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice,
has benevolence no claim on the female sex? "The fact is, that
an unguarded fondness for ornament has been known, in a multitude
of examples, to overpower the natural tenderness of the female
mind, and to prevent the growth and establishment of dispositions
pronounced in the gospel to be indispensably requisite to the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
character. If the purse be generally kept low by the demands
of milliners, of mantua-makers, dealers in trinkets, and of others
who bear their part in adorning the person, little can be allotted to
the applications of charity. But charity requires, in common with
other virtues, the fostering influence of habit. If the custom of
devoting an adequate portion of the income to the relief of distress
be long intermitted, the desire of giving relief will gradually be
impaired. The heart forgets, by disuse, the emotions in which it
once delighted. The ear turns from solicitations now become unwelcome.
In proportion as the wants and the griefs of others are disregarded,
the spirit of selfishness strikes deeper and stronger roots
in the breast. Let the generous exertions of kindness be tempered
with discretion: but let a disposition to those exertions be encouraged
on principles of duty; and confirmed, in proportion to the
ability of the individual, by frequency of practice. Before the world
has repressed, by its interested lessons, the warmth of youthful
benevolence, let experience establish a conviction that the greatest
of all pleasures is to do good. She who has accustomed herself to
this delight, will not easily be induced to forego it. She will feel,
that whatever she is able, without penuriousness or improper singularity,
to withdraw from the expense of personal ornament, is not
only reserved for much higher purposes, but for purposes productive
of exquisite and permanent gratification.</p>

<p>"Another, and a very important benefit which results from fixed
habits of moderation as to dress, and all points of a similar nature,
will be clearly discerned by adverting to the irreparable evils into
which young women are sometimes plunged by the contrary practice.
The lavish indulgence in which they have learned to seek for happiness,
becoming, in their estimation, essential to their comfort, is able
to bias their conduct in every important step. Hence, in forming
matrimonial connections, it exercises perhaps a secret, but a very
powerful influence. The prospect of wealth and magnificence, of
the continuance and of the increase of pleasures supposed to flow
from the pomp of dress and equipage, from sumptuous mansions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
showy furniture, and numerous attendants, dazzles the judgment,
imposes on the affections, conceals many defects in moral character,
and compensates for others. It frequently proves the decisive circumstance
which leads the deluded victim to the altar, there to consign
herself to splendid misery for life.</p>

<p>"There are yet other consequences which attend an immoderate
passion for the embellishments of dress. When the mind is fixed
upon objects which derive their chief value from administering to
vanity and the love of admiration, the aversion, which almost every
individual of either sex is prone to feel towards a rival, is particularly
called forth. And when objects attainable so easily as exterior
ornaments occupy the heart, there will be rivals without number.
Hence, it is not uncommon to see neighbouring young women engaged
in a constant state of petty warfare with each other. To vie
in ostentatiousness, in costliness, or in elegance of apparel&mdash;to be
distinguished by novel inventions in personal decoration&mdash;to gain
the earliest intelligence respecting changes of fashion in the metropolis&mdash;to
detect, in the attire of a luckless competitor, traces of a
mode which for six weeks has been obsolete in high life&mdash;these frequently
are the points of excellence to which the force of female
genius is directed. In the meantime, while the mask of friendship
is worn, and the language of regard is on the tongue, indifference,
disgust, and envy are gradually taking possession of the breast;
until, at length, the unworthy contest, prolonged for years under
habits of dissimilation, by which neither of the parties are deceived,
terminates in the violence of an open rupture.</p>

<p>"The Scriptures have spoken so plainly and so strongly respecting
solicitude about dress, that I cannot quit the subject without a
special reference to their authority. Our Saviour, in one of his most
solemn discourses, warns his followers against anxiety as to 'wherewithal
they should be clothed,' in a manner particularly emphatic,
classing that anxiety with the despicable pursuits of those who are
studious 'what they shall eat, and what they shall drink;' and by
pronouncing all such cares to be among the characteristics by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the heathens were distinguished. It ought to be observed, that these
admonitions of Christ respect men no less than women. The apostle
Paul speaks pointedly concerning female dress, saying&mdash;'I will,
in like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel,
with shame-facedness and sobriety: not with broidered hair, or gold,
or pearls, or costly array; but, which becometh women professing
godliness, with good works.' In another passage, St. Peter also
speaks expressly of the female sex: and primarily of married women,
but in terms applicable with equal propriety to the single&mdash;'Whose
adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair
and of wearing of gold, and of putting on of apparel. But let it
be the hidden man of the heart' (the inward frame and disposition
of the mind), 'in that which is not corruptible; even the ornament
of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price.' It would be too much to assert, on the one hand, that it was
the intention of either of the apostles, in giving these directions,
to proscribe the use of the particular kinds of personal ornament
which he specifies; but, on the other hand, it was unquestionably
the design of both, to proscribe whatever may justly be styled solicitude
respecting any kind of personal decoration; and to censure
those who, instead of resting their claim to approbation solely on
the tempers of the soul, in any degree, should ambitiously seek to
be noticed and praised for exterior embellishments, as deviating
precisely in that degree from the simplicity and the purity of the
Christian character."</p>

<p>The young ladies of the Holmes family, were allowed a stated
income to meet their current expenditure, besides receiving occasional
presents. One custom prevailed in this family, which the
writer hopes will never become extinct amongst us, as it belongs so
appropriately to the English character. The birthdays, especially
those of the parents, were duly celebrated, and an interchange of
presents made between the members of the family. On the occasion
of the recurrence of Mr. Holmes' birthday, which took place a few
weeks after the party referred to in the foregoing chapter, the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
compliment of presents was made in the morning; and in the afternoon,
after the old gentleman's health, and many happy returns of
the day, had been drunk with due honours, he presented to each of
his daughters an envelope, containing a bank note for Â£20.</p>

<p>In the evening, as the young ladies were taking their walk, their
conversation turned on the unexpected liberality of their father,
when Emma asked her sisters what they intended to purchase.</p>

<p>"I intend," said Jane, "to purchase my freedom."</p>

<p>"Your freedom, my dear!" said the facetious Emma; "I did not
know that you were in bondage to any man; but if you are, surely
you do not think of offering to pay him for your liberty?"</p>

<p>"I am not," replied Jane, "in bondage to <em>any man</em>."</p>

<p>"No! To whom then?"</p>

<p>"To woman kind!"</p>

<p>"Woman! What! Woman enslave her own sex!"</p>

<p>"Even so."</p>

<p>"What woman are you in bondage to?"</p>

<p>"The mantua-maker! Here are the fetters of my captivity (exhibiting
the undischarged bills), which I will now go and break
asunder, and hope never more to wear them."</p>

<p>"You are to be commended, my dear," said Miss Holmes, "and I
hope Emma will follow your example; for, with our liberal allowance,
and the presents we receive, we ought to have something to
spare to the claims of religion and benevolence, rather than have
the disgrace of unpaid bills lying in our drawers."</p>

<p>"Indeed," Emma replied, "I think Papa gives away quite enough
to purchase our redemption from the taxes of charity. When I am
settled in life, it is my intention to appropriate a regular sum to
charitable purposes, but now I cannot afford it. We must be just
before we are generous."</p>

<p>"On that maxim I shall act," said Jane; "I will discharge my
debts as an act of justice, and then I shall have it in my power to
be generous to the poor and needy."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, Emma," remarked Miss Holmes, "that you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
sincere in your proposed intentions respecting your future charities;
but I suspect, if you go upon the principle of waiting till you
are rich, you will never have anything to give. You must know,
dear Emma, if you reflect on the subject, that you are now forming
your habits for life&mdash;giving to your principles and propensities a
fixed and changeless tendency; and is it not of great importance
that you should begin now to cultivate the virtues of charity and
self-denial?"</p>

<p>"It may be so, but there is no rule without an exception; and as
your habits and mine, dear sister, are so dissimilar, you cannot
expect that I can follow your example in all things."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear, follow the example of Jane, and you will feel
more at ease; and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that
those you are indebted to are not distressed by the want of the
money you owe them."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am at ease. They charge enough, for the few articles
I purchase, to allow me to take a long credit."</p>

<p>"That is very true. They charge in proportion to the length of
credit they give; and hence, you pay such an exorbitant price for
your dress. You impoverish yourself by the very method you employ
in expending your money; and never have the satisfaction of being
free from the pressing claims of dress-makers and milliners. Thus
you deny yourself the noble gratification of relieving the necessities
of others; for when an appeal is made to your benevolence, you are
obliged to resist it, because you have previously exhausted your
resources."</p>

<p>"You reason admirably, dear sister, and I shall not forget your
observations; but I must get a new dress, as I have worn my old
one so long. I will spare something out of the next present Papa
gives me. I hope this will satisfy you, as you know I always keep
my word."</p>

<p>It is, generally, in the more private occurrences of domestic life,
that the peculiarities of the human mind are developed; and events,
trivial in themselves, often acquire a degree of importance from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
indications of character which they exhibit. The bestowment of a
birthday present, was an expression of paternal regard, but what
different dispositions and tendencies did it call forth, and what a
different moral effect did it produce!&mdash;Miss Holmes devoted a portion
of her present to the claims of charity and religion, and with part
of the remainder, she purchased a silver snuff-box, which she presented
to her father, with a few appropriate verses. Jane, who had
been enticed into extravagance by following the example of her
sister Emma, went and discharged her debts; while Emma, after
ordering her dress, and paying a sum towards her previous account,
took a fancy to a beautiful shawl, and ordered it to be sent to the
Elms, and in this way got deeper in debt than she had been before.</p>

<h2>AMUSEMENTS.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_348.jpg" alt="M" width="100" height="108" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Miss Orme, the friend of Emma Holmes, accepted an
invitation to spend a few weeks at the Elms, and being
aware of the religious habits of the family, she resolved
to conform to them with the most scrupulous exactness.
When she played, she generally selected sacred music, as a compliment
to the taste of her pious friends; and even condescended to
accompany them to chapel, though she avowed her decided preference
for the forms and ceremonies of the Church. She was naturally
of a very pliable disposition, and had she been under a different
course of moral training, she might have devoted her attention to
the claims of religion; but being surrounded by the fascinations of
gay life, and taught to regard the pursuit of pleasure as the chief
end of her existence, she became one of the most zealous devotees
that ever bowed down at the shrine of fashion. She possessed an
intelligent mind; but the books she read, and the subjects on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
she generally conversed, had a tendency to impair its strength, and
to keep it from ranging in the field of useful knowledge. She was
rather shrewd, and would sometimes make a reply, or give a turn
to an observation with considerable effect; but her resources were
soon exhausted, and she would fall back into a state of ennui, unless
the conversation related to the fashions or the amusements of the
day, and then she would speak with great fluency and animation.
In her disposition, she was so good-natured and amiable, that she
would bear reproof with the utmost degree of mildness, but never
thought of amending her ways; would acknowledge herself in the
wrong, when it was pointed out to her, yet persisted in its practice;
and often confessed that she had no doubt but a religious life was
most acceptable to our Maker, yet as often expressed her astonishment
that any young person could think of becoming religious.</p>
</div>

<p>As Mr. Holmes could not conscientiously suffer his daughters to
attend any of the public amusements to which society devotes such
a considerable portion of its time, he endeavoured to compensate for
the loss of such sources of gratification, by making them happy in
their home; and by treating them with occasional excursions, where
they might enjoy a change of air and of scenery, without running the
risk of sustaining any moral injury. To gratify her friend, Emma
had persuaded her father to take them to Windsor, where they were
to spend one night, and return the following day; but there had
been so much rain in the early part of the morning, and it continued
to descend in such torrents, that they were obliged to postpone their
visit. This disappointment was borne with great cheerfulness by
all but Miss Orme, who felt it to be a most irksome burden, and
said more than once during the day, "What a misfortune that Providence
should allow it to rain to-day, when, I suppose, he knew we
were going to Windsor!"</p>

<p>"Why, perhaps," said Mr. Holmes, "he has sent the rain to prevent
some calamitous accident."</p>

<p>"Dear Sir, do you think he ever pays any attention to us, and
such little things as a pleasure excursion?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, most certainly. Our Saviour says&mdash;'Are not two sparrows
sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall to the ground
without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all
numbered.'"</p>

<p>"Then of course it is so, but it never struck me before. I always
thought that God looked after other worlds and their inhabitants,
and that he left us to our fate."</p>

<p>"You forget the first petition in the Lord's Prayer&mdash;'<em>Our Father</em>,
who art in heaven.' A kind father&mdash;and God is love&mdash;pays great
attention to his children."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, Sir, but it never struck me before."</p>

<p>As she was sauntering up and down the house, leaning on the arm
of Emma, bitterly deploring the continued descent of the rain, which
precluded the hope of their getting out of doors, she broke in upon
Miss Holmes, busily engaged in finishing a dress for a poor woman,
who was daily expecting the birth of her firstborn.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Holmes, for this act of intrusion. We
are sauntering away dull time."</p>

<p>"Walk in, and I will give you some employment."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am not fit for work. This is one of the dullest days
of my life. I wish the rain was over and gone. Is it not a great
misfortune that it should come to-day?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, my dear Miss Orme, it is sent by our heavenly Father
to prevent some greater misfortune."</p>

<p>"That's what your Papa has just been telling us. What a striking
coincidence between his sentiments and yours! They are new
ideas to me. Very devout and proper."</p>

<p>"Sister is Papa's living echo," remarked Emma.</p>

<p>"As you two idlers," said Miss Holmes, "have nothing to do
but saunter away time, perhaps (addressing Miss Orme) you would
have no objection to read, it may prove a little relief to your dulness."</p>

<p>There were several books lying on the table, which she carelessly
examined and closed, when Emma said, "Here is one which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
have not seen." She took it, read the title&mdash;<cite>An Inquiry into the
Duties of the Female Sex</cite>. "A learned dissertation, I have no doubt,
on woman. I wonder what he says. He has, I see, a chapter on
the employment of time; shall I read that, Miss Holmes?"</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>"Time is a sacred trust consigned to us by the Creator of the
universe. To use it well is a lesson which duty and reason concur
to suggest. The duration of the period to be confided to our management,
though predetermined in the counsels of Omniscience, is
undisclosed to the individual concerned, and is placed beyond the
reach of calculation; that uncertainty respecting the future may
operate as a continual and powerful admonition wisely to employ
the present hour. Would you perceive the ingratitude and folly of
squandering so precious a deposit? Reflect on the gracious purposes
for the accomplishment of which it is committed to you. Reflect
how plainly incompatible a habit of squandering it is, with the frame
of mind which is the fruit of Christianity. Reflect on the infinite
importance which you will hereafter attach to time past, when the
consequences flowing from the right or wrong use of it, will be discerned
and felt by you in their full extent."</p>

<p>"This is too grave a subject for me," said Miss Orme. "It will
just add to the load of melancholy on my mind, which is already
oppressed beyond endurance by the horrid gloom of the weather.
I am fond of reading, but I prefer the lighter productions of the
press." She closed the book and was taking up another, when
Miss Holmes said, "You will oblige me by reading another paragraph
in that chapter, which may prove advantageous to you, even
though it may not exactly accord with your present taste."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"To every woman, whether single or married, the habit of regularly
allotting to improving books a portion of each day, and, as far
as may be practicable, at stated hours, cannot be too strongly recommended.
I use the term <em>improving</em> in a large sense; as comprehending
all writings which may contribute to her virtue, her usefulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and her innocent gratification&mdash;to her happiness in this world
and in the next. She who believes that she is to survive in another
state of being through eternity, and is duly impressed by the awful
conviction, will fix, day by day, her most serious thoughts on the
inheritance to which she aspires. Where the treasure is, there will
her heart be also. She will not be seduced from an habitual study
of the Holy Scriptures, and of other works calculated to imprint
on her mind the comparatively small importance of the pains and
pleasures of this period of existence; and to fill her with that knowledge,
and inspire her with those views and dispositions, which may
lead her to delight in the present service of her Maker, and enable
her to rejoice in the contemplation of futurity. At other seasons,
let history, let biography, let poetry, or some of the various branches
of elegant and profitable knowledge, pay their tribute of instruction
and amusement. But let whatever she peruses in her most private
hours be such as she needs not to be ashamed of reading aloud to
those whose good opinion she is most anxious to deserve. Let her
remember that there is an all-seeing eye, which is ever fixed upon
her, even in her closest retirement. Let her not indulge herself in
the frequent perusal of writings, however interesting in their nature,
however eminent in a literary point of view, which are likely to
inflame pride, and to inspire false notions of generosity, of feeling,
of spirit, or of any other quality. Such, unhappily, are the effects
to be apprehended from the works even of several of our distinguished
writers, in prose and in verse. And let her accustom herself
regularly to bring the sentiments which she reads, and the conduct
which is described in terms, more or less strong, of applause
and recommendation, to the test of Christian principles. In proportion
as this practice is pursued or neglected, reading will be profitable
or pernicious."</p>

<p>"Now, really, my dear Miss Holmes," said Miss Orme, stopping
short, "I cannot go on with such reading. Have you nothing in the
shape of a novel? I can take an interest in <em>that</em>. You object to such
compositions, I believe?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But why, when they display so much ingenuity, are so delightful,
and have such a good moral tendency?"</p>

<p>"I cannot reply to your present remark in more forcible language
than the writer has done, whose book you hold in your hand, and if
you will permit me I will read an extract."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Miss Orme, with a yawn.</p>

<p>"Works of this nature not unfrequently deserve the praise of
ingenuity of plan and contrivance, of accurate and well-supported
discrimination of character, and of force and elegance of language.
Some of them have professedly been composed with a design to favour
the interests of morality. And among those which are deemed to
have, on the whole, a moral tendency, a very few, perhaps, might be
selected, which are not liable to the disgraceful charge of being occasionally
contaminated by incidents and passions unfit to be represented
to the reader. This charge, however, may so very generally
be alleged with justice, that even of the novels which possess high
and established reputation, by far the greater number is totally improper,
in consequence of such admixture, to be perused by the eye
of delicacy. Poor indeed are the services rendered to virtue by a
writer, however he may boast that the object of his performance is
to exhibit the vicious as infamous and unhappy, who, in tracing the
progress of vice to infamy and unhappiness, introduces the readers
to scenes and language adapted to wear away the quick feelings of
modesty, which form at once the ornament and safeguard of innocence;
and, like the bloom upon a plum, if once effaced, commonly
disappear for ever. To indulge in a practice of reading novels is,
in several other particulars, liable to produce mischievous effects.
Such compositions are, to most people, extremely engaging. That
story must be singularly barren, or wretchedly told, of which, having
heard the beginning, we desire not to know the end. To the pleasure
of learning the ultimate fortunes of the heroes and heroines of the
tale, the novel commonly adds, in a greater or less degree, that which
arises from animated description, from lively dialogue, or from interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
sentiment. Hence, the perusal of one publication of this class
leads, with much more frequency than is the case with respect to
works of other kinds (except, perhaps, of dramatic writings, to which
most of the present remarks may be transferred), to the speedy perusal
of another. Thus a habit is formed&mdash;a habit at first, perhaps,
of limited indulgence&mdash;but a habit that is continually found more
formidable and more encroaching. The appetite becomes too keen
to be denied; and in proportion as it is more urgent, grows less nice
and select in its fare. What would formerly have given offence now
gives none. The palate is vitiated or made dull. The produce of
the book-club, and the contents of the circulating library, are devoured
with indiscriminate and insatiable avidity. Hence, the mind
is secretly corrupted. Let it be observed too, that in exact correspondence
with the increase of a passion for reading novels, an aversion
to reading of a more improving nature will gather strength.
Even in the class of novels least objectionable in point of delicacy,
false sentiment unfitting the mind for sober life, applause and censure
distributed amiss, morality estimated by an erroneous standard,
and the capricious laws and empty sanctions of honour set up in the
place of religion, are the lessons usually presented. There is yet
another consequence too important to be overlooked. The catastrophe
and the incidents of these fictitious narratives commonly turn
on the vicissitudes and effects of a passion, the most powerful which
agitates the human heart. Hence, the study of them frequently
creates a susceptibility of impression, and a premature warmth of
tender emotions, which, not to speak of other possible effects, have
been known to betray young women into a sudden attachment to
persons unworthy of their affection, and thus to hurry them into
marriages terminating in unhappiness."</p>

<p>"He reasons excellently well against such books; but to be candid,
dear Miss Holmes, and I know you idolize candour, I must confess
I am rather partial to them. They serve to beguile away the
tedious hours of unoccupied time, and remove us to an enchanted
land where we forget the mortifications of life. Then they often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
enable us to get through a day with tolerable composure, when we
are prevented taking our walks or drives abroad. And what a relief
do they afford us when indisposed! Indeed, I don't know what I
should do, if I were interdicted from such a source of exquisite gratification."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt but such reading affords you gratification, and
enables you to get through the tedious hours of time with some degree
of patience; but is it profitable? Does it enlarge and strengthen
the intellectual faculty, or extend the boundary of our practical
knowledge? Does it refine the <em>moral</em> taste, or call into action the
best feelings of our nature? Does it tend to prepare us for our final
destiny, as candidates for immortality?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. Then, as you object to the novel, I presume
you are equally averse to the card-table?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"But why, when it affords so much gratification?"</p>

<p>"Because it often gives rise to a passion for gaming, which has
brought many to ruin."</p>

<p>"Well, I will admit, that it does sometimes lead to such a fatal
issue; but I will suppose a case which frequently occurs in social life.
A virtuous family receives a visit from a few select friends; and in
the evening the card-tables are brought out, and they divide themselves
into small parties, and play a few games for their own amusement,
without risking more than a few shillings. Now, what evil
can result from such a method of passing away the evening?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, there is a great sacrifice of time, without any
adequate compensation. If the time thus devoted to an unprofitable
amusement were employed in instructive conversation, some moral
benefit would result from it. Then important and interesting questions
might be discussed and answered&mdash;the events of the day would
pass under review&mdash;enlivening anecdotes might be told&mdash;and every
one would have an opportunity of displaying and increasing the
resources of his mind."</p>

<p>"But, begging pardon for interrupting you, does not the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of cards, by occupying the attention of a party, prevent the conversation
from degenerating into gossip and scandal? This advantage
you have overlooked, but I have no doubt, on reflection, you
will admit it to be a very important one."</p>

<p>"Why not, dear Miss Orme, allow a sense of honour and strict
integrity to impose restraint on the tongue of scandal, without requiring
the charm of the card-table to do it? This principle, when
inwrought in the mind, will be always present, and vigilant in the
exercise of its restraining power; but you cannot always have the
card-table with you. But now to advert to the hypothetical case of
the virtuous family receiving a visit from a few select friends. I
admit, that they may sustain no positive injury, either moral or
social, by spending the evening together in such a way; but if we
advert to some facts which have come within our own knowledge,
we must admit, that some of the party may sustain great, if not
irreparable injury. I know a lady who never touched a pack of
cards till after her marriage, but as soon as she did touch them, she
became passionately fond of them. She first played with her husband&mdash;then
a few select friends were invited to the game&mdash;then larger
parties thronged her drawing-room&mdash;till at length, the passion became
so inveterate in its influence over her, that she neglected all
her domestic duties, involved her husband in pecuniary embarrassments
by the sums she lost; and eventually abandoned her home
and children, with a worthless wretch, who, after degrading her,
threw her off on the merciless contempt of the world! In a conversation
which I lately had with her, when endeavouring to point
her to Him who came to save sinners (for she is now in the last stage
of a decline), she owned that her ruin was owing to her passion for
cards, which became so strong that she was unable to control it."</p>

<p>"This is a most painful case," observed Miss Orme: "happily an
extreme one!"</p>

<p>"I admit this; but there is no disputing this fact, that card-playing
very frequently kindles in the female breast, no less than in the
breast of the other sex, a passion for gaming. Yes, many a husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
would have been saved from ruin, if his wife had employed that
influence to subdue his passion for the card-table, which she has
employed to keep it alive and vigorous. She has lived to deplore
the evil, when it has become irreparable."</p>

<p>"Both the novel and the card-table," remarked Emma, "are the
forbidden fruit of our Eden."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, my dear," replied Miss Orme, "that your parents
act conscientiously in prohibiting novels and cards; but you know
that religious people, in general, do so: though I have known some
rather conspicuous professors who have not objected to play a game
at whist after family prayer in the evening."</p>

<p>"Yes, and so have I. I was on a visit at Mr. Ridout's, some few
months since, when the card-table was brought out for our amusement;
and I don't know when I have spent a more pleasant evening."</p>

<p>"And who is Mr. Ridout, my dear? Is he a pious man, or does
he belong to the world?"</p>

<p>"He professes to be a pious man; and I should suppose he is one,
for he has prayer in his family morning and evening."</p>

<p>"Had he family prayer, the evening you refer to, <em>before</em> or <em>after</em>
the games were introduced?"</p>

<p>"O! it was omitted that evening."</p>

<p>"And why, Emma," here interposed Miss Holmes, "was it omitted?
Was it not because he was ashamed to place the Bible on the same
table with the cards; and because, after enticing others to a conformity
to the customs of the world, he could not, in their presence, go
and pray, that they might be renewed in the spirit of their mind?
Do you recollect the remark which you made on your return home?"</p>

<p>"It has escaped my recollection."</p>

<p>"That he wanted only one thing to finish his character."</p>

<p>"And did I say what that one thing was?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you said, and said very justly, it was consistency."</p>

<p>"O! I recollect, that was the opinion I then entertained."</p>

<p>"And have you changed your opinion? Do you not think that
religious people ought to abstain from the appearance of evil? Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
your moral sense, dear Emma, receive no offence, when you see a
person, who makes a profession of personal piety, acting like a worldling?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does. I remember that droll creature, Bessie Lane, came
and whispered in my ear, just as we began a fresh game,&mdash;'Make
haste, as Mr. Ridout has just rung the bell for prayers!' This remark
was heard by all our party; and I must confess that I was
hurt by some of the observations which were made."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Miss Orme, "why the most religious people
may not indulge themselves in these amusements as well as others;
but certainly we think it strange when they do so."</p>

<p>"I love consistency," replied Miss Holmes. "If a family have
prayer, they ought not, in my opinion, to spend the evenings in games
which certainly have not a religious tendency; and if they have these
games, they had better leave off prayer, as they cannot be prepared
for it. I knew a young friend, the daughter of pious parents, who once
had her mind very deeply impressed by a sense of the vanity of the
world and the importance of religion; but in consequence of paying
a visit to the house of a professor, who in the temple was grave, and
in the parlour gay&mdash;who alternately played and prayed, sang songs
or psalms, as fancy dictated&mdash;she lost all her pious impressions, and
from that time she became inveterately averse to religion; and in a
conversation which passed between us only a few days since, a reference
being made to it, she frankly said she could not conquer her
aversion, and she thought she never should. Example has a powerful
influence, especially in doing moral injury; but the most pernicious
and dangerous, is the example of a religious man who acts in
opposition to the obligations of his profession&mdash;who, while he professes
to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, displays a spirit that is at
variance with the sacredness of that character&mdash;and retains his religious
habits, even while he conforms to the customs of the world."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Miss Holmes, no one will impeach your consistency;
for you are, without exception, one of the most decidedly
religious I ever knew."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Emma, "my sister goes rather too far; and I sometimes
tell her that she is in danger of becoming a Pharisee. She
sees, or think she sees, a dangerous moral tendency in almost every
amusement; and such is the influence she possesses over the fears
of our parents, that they are kept in a state of constant terror lest
I should read a novel or dance a polka."</p>

<p>"And is it possible, my dear Miss Holmes, that either you or your
parents can object to dancing!&mdash;an exercise so conducive to health&mdash;so
calculated to give elegance to the form, to the walk, and to the
action&mdash;an accomplishment of so much importance, that no female
can be fit to move in polished society who has not attained it? I
believe you learned at school, dear Emma; did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but now I am not permitted to go out to parties, which I
consider very mortifying. My parents allowed me to learn; and
now I have learned, and am fond of the amusement, they will not
suffer me to practise, except at home, where we never have any
dancing parties."</p>

<p>"This is sadly mortifying."</p>

<p>"They permitted you to learn dancing," replied her sister, "that
you might derive from it those personal accomplishments which Miss
Orme has so well described; but as they are aware of its dangerous
moral tendency, they very properly object to your going into large
mixed parties."</p>

<p>"Then ought they not to have refused letting me learn to dance,
if they intended to deny me the pleasure of it?<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This is like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
father teaching his son the art of engraving, and then taking away
his tools lest he should be transported for coining."</p>

<p>"You may dance for the purposes for which you were permitted
to learn; but I appeal to your good sense, if it be not an act of kindness,
on the part of our parents, in withholding their consent from
your visiting the ball-room, when they apprehend you will sustain
some moral injury?"</p>

<p>"But you know, dear Miss Holmes," remarked Miss Orme, "that
the chief gratification which we derive from any attainment or accomplishment,
is the opportunity of displaying it. What pleasure would
there be in learning to paint, unless we had the liberty of exhibiting
our drawings&mdash;or who would submit to the labour of learning the
notes of the gamut, if, after she has succeeded, she is to be prohibited
from playing?"</p>

<p>"We certainly ought to acquire the accomplishments which are
necessary to fit us to act our parts in refined society; but to acquire
them for the purpose of mere display, will be productive of two
evils: in the first place, it will injure the moral tone of our mind;
and, in the next place, it will expose us to the severe satire of the
opposite sex, who have little charity for female vanity."</p>

<p>"I am sure the gentlemen admire a lady who can sing well, and
play well, and dance well, and move with grace as she enters or
leaves a room."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Miss Orme; but if she have no higher accomplishments,
though she may be admired, she will not be respected; she
may have her name mentioned with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eclÃ¢t</i> in the circles of fashion,
but she will not be held in esteem among the wise and the good;
and she may do very well as a partner for a quadrille, but no man
of sense would think of her as his companion for life. The bee is
an insect of more value than the butterfly."</p>

<p>"But do you wish the assembly-rooms deserted? If so, I fear you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
will never have your wishes realized. But, to come to the point,
what are the evils which you think result from such scenes of
amusement?"</p>

<p>"I do not expect to see such places deserted, as they hold out so
many attractions; but they are productive of so many evils, that I
consider them essentially injurious to the morals of society. There
is the expense which they incur, and the long train of evils which
often follow. What costly dresses! What a profusion of useless
ornaments must be purchased, beside the incidental items of expense
in going and returning, and paying for the admission ticket! If the
whole expense of one evening's gratification were accurately calculated,
it would astonish us. And what is the consequence of this?
The bills of tradesmen are often left undischarged&mdash;the claims of
benevolence are rejected&mdash;and a habit of useless extravagance is
formed, which extends its destructive influence to other branches of
domestic expenditure. But I have a still more serious objection to
urge against such scenes of amusement: the perilous risk which a
female often runs. She goes clad in a light attire&mdash;moves about in
a warm room&mdash;and then suddenly exposes herself, without any adequate
increase of clothing, to a cold and damp atmosphere, by which
she often sacrifices her health, and sometimes her life."</p>

<p>"But you know, Miss Holmes, that this objection will apply with
equal force against our attending a crowded place of worship."</p>

<p>"Not with equal force; because in a place of worship we remain
still during the time of service, and usually go in warmer, not to
say in more decent attire. The moral influence which such public
amusements have over the mind, is another very powerful objection
against them. By your permission I will read a paragraph from a
good writer, who expresses himself in very correct and forcible
language:&mdash;'The objects which, during the season of youth, most
easily excite vanity and envy in the female breast, are those which
are presented in the ball-room. This is deemed the stage for displaying
the attractions, by the possession of which a young woman
is apt to be most elated; and they are here displayed under circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
most calculated to call forth the triumph and the animosities
of personal competition. This triumph and these animosities betray
themselves occasionally to the least discerning eye. But were the
recesses of the heart laid open, how often would the sight of a stranger,
of an acquaintance, even of a friend, superior for the evening
in the attractions of dress, or enjoying the supposed advantage of
having secured a wealthier, a more lively, a more graceful, or a more
fashionable partner, be found to excite feelings of disgust and of aversion,
not always stopping short of malevolence! How often would
the passions be seen inflamed, and every nerve agitated, by a thirst
for precedence; and invention be observed labouring to mortify a
rival by the affectation of indifference or of contempt!'"</p>

<p>"But do you not think it possible for a female to attend a ball
without having her breast inflated with vanity, or surcharged with
envy?"</p>

<p>"I certainly admit that it is possible, but not probable. If she
excel others in the richness or the elegance of her dress, or if she
receive any peculiar marks of attention, will she not feel the flush
of vain-glory? And if others excel her, or receive more marked
attentions, will she not retire from the company stung with envy?
And can either of these passions be excited without producing some
demoralizing effect? If she become devoted to her personal decoration,
she will be under a strong temptation to neglect the improvement
of her mind; and while this passion enslaves and governs her,
the more amiable and lovely graces will be neglected. And if she
become envious of the superior attainments or honours of others,
she will be restless&mdash;mortified, consume her time and expend her
money in making useless efforts to equal or surpass them, and may
be induced to invent or to circulate tales of calumny to their injury."</p>

<p>"But you do not mean to say that these effects are invariably produced?"</p>

<p>"Not invariably; because there are some females who merely visit
these places as a passing compliment to the fashion of the age. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
attend as spectators of the scene, rather than as actors<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;to oblige
a friend, rather than gratify themselves; and having accomplished
the design of their visit, they retire uninjured, because they felt no
desire to be seen or heard, alike indifferent whether they have been
the objects of attention or have remained unnoticed."</p>

<p>"You have stated the evils which you think often result from such
public amusements, but you have made no allusion to the advantages
which attend them; amongst which I reckon, the introduction which
they give to the best society. You know that we are confined within
the precincts of home&mdash;our duties and pursuits are of the more retired
order&mdash;and though we may take our walks, and occasionally
go to Bath or Cheltenham, or some other fashionable resort, yet, if
it were not for these public amusements, we should have no opportunity
of being introduced to the company of the other sex. Here
we are brought together; and you know, dear Miss Holmes, that
the most important consequences often follow."</p>

<p>"Very true; but these important consequences are not always the
most beneficial. The writer to whom I have previously referred,
has made some good remarks on this subject, which, by your permission,
I will read to you:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'An evil of great moment, which is too frequently known to
occur at the places of amusement now under notice, is the introduction
of women to undesirable and improper acquaintance among the
other sex; undesirable and improper, as I would now be understood
to mean, in a moral point of view. Men of this description commonly
abound at all scenes of public resort and entertainment,
who are distinguished by fortune and birth&mdash;gay and conciliating
manners&mdash;and every qualification which is needful to procure a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
favourable reception in polite company. Hence, when they propose
themselves as partners in an assembly-room, a lady does not always
find it easy, according to the rules of decorum, to decline the offer;
and she is sometimes enticed, by their external appearance, and by
having seen other ladies ambitious of dancing with them, into a
reprehensible inclination not to decline it.</p>

<p>"'Women, in various occurrences of life, are betrayed by a dread
of appearing ungenteelly bashful, and by a desire of rendering themselves
agreeable, into an indiscreet freedom of manners and conversation
with men of whom they know perhaps but little; and still
more frequently, into a greater degree of freedom with those of whom
they have more knowledge than can fitly be indulged, except towards
persons with whom they are connected by particular ties. The temptation
is in no place more powerful than in a ball-room. Let not
indiscriminate familiarity be shown towards all partners, nor injudicious
familiarity towards any. To reject every boisterous and
unbecoming mode of dancing, and to observe, in every point, the
strictest modesty in attire, are cautions on which, in addressing
women of delicacy, it is surely needless to insist.'"</p>

<p>"Well, I assure you, my dear Miss Holmes, I think both you and
the writer you have just quoted, overrate the dangers to which we
are exposed by attending such scenes of amusement; for I have never
known a friend injured by them, nor have I ever heard of such a
thing."</p>

<p>"You forget what befell Miss Moss."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>
<p>"I beg pardon. I do. Ah! that was a tragical event."</p>

<p>"And how many tragical events have risen out of these scenes of
amusement! You have read, I have no doubt, the following account
of one which befell a very holy man:&mdash;'When Herod's birth-day was
kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased
Herod. Whereupon he promised, with an oath, to give her whatsoever
she would ask. And she, being before instructed of her mother,
said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. And the king
was sorry: nevertheless, for the oath's sake, and them which sat
with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. And he sent,
and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a
charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.'
How this damsel could so far subdue the common feelings of human
nature, and still more the natural tenderness of her own sex, as not
only to endure so disgusting a spectacle, but even to carry the bleeding
trophy in triumph to her mother, is not easy to imagine; but it
shows, that a life of fashionable gaiety and dissipation not only prevents
the growth of the more amiable and useful virtues, but sometimes
calls into action those feelings and passions which lead to
rapine and murder."</p>

<p>The late excellent Bishop Horne closes his life of St. John in such
a forcible and beautiful manner, that the author does not conceive it
necessary to offer any apology to his readers for its insertion on the
present occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Baptist's fate being determined, 'immediately the king sent
an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went,
and beheaded him in the prison.' This deed of darkness must have
been done in the season proper for it&mdash;the middle of the night; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
St. John was probably awakened, to receive his sentence, out of that
sleep which truth and innocence can secure to their possessor in any
situation. The generality of mankind have reason enough to deprecate
a sudden death, lest it should surprise them in one of their
many unguarded hours. But to St. John no hour could be such.
He had finished the work which God had given him to do. He had
kept the faith, and preserved a conscience void of offence. He had
done his duty, and waited daily and hourly, we may be sure, for his
departure. He was now, therefore, called off from his station with
honour&mdash;to quit the well-fought field for the palace of the Great King&mdash;to
refresh himself, after the dust, and toil, and heat of the day, by
bathing in the fountain of life and immortality&mdash;to exchange his
blood-stained armour for a robe of glory&mdash;and to have his temporary
labours rewarded with eternal rest&mdash;to sit down with Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of God&mdash;and as the friend of
the Bridegroom, to enter into the joy of his Lord. From the darkness
and confinement of a prison, he passed to the liberty and light
of heaven; and while malice was gratified with a sight of his head,
and his body was carried by a few friends in silence to the grave,
his immortal spirit repaired to a court, where no Herod desires to
have his brother's wife&mdash;where no Herodias thirsts after the blood
of a prophet&mdash;where he who hath laboured with sincerity and diligence
in the work of reformation is sure to be well received&mdash;where
holiness, zeal, and constancy are crowned, and receive palms from
the Son of God, whom they confessed in the world.</p>

<h2>THE UNHAPPY ATTACHMENT.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_367.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The institution of marriage is a provision made by Divine
Providence to promote human happiness; but owing
to the imprudence and haste with which it is sometimes
contracted, it not unfrequently becomes a source of extreme
wretchedness. This union should never be formed, except by
those who have a strong affection for each other; and even then, the
utmost degree of prudence should regulate their conduct, both in the
appointment of the time when it should take place, and the adjustment
of the various interests which it involves. When persons marry
mainly for the purpose of adding to their worldly estate, or obtaining
a higher position in society, it rarely happens that an alliance
entered into from such motives can be productive of domestic happiness.
And even when the purest feelings of affection and love influence
the youthful pair, inspiring them with the determination to
sacrifice the esteem of friends, and the attractions of this world's
wealth, rather than break the solemn vow and separate for life, they
should beware of rashness and headlong impetuosity, pondering
well the desirableness of the connection they are about to form, and
feeling well assured that it is really a step which must conduce to
their welfare.</p>
</div>

<p>When persons, who have no parents or judicious friends whom
they can consult, are making arrangements for marriage, they should
exercise more than ordinary discretion, lest they plunge themselves
into difficulties from which no one can rescue them. But when parents
are living, not to consult them, and pay some degree of deference
to their opinion, is an offence against the law of propriety, and
generally productive of the most fatal evils. Parents are more deeply
interested in the marriage of their children than any other persons,
and no pledges ought to be given between the contracting parties till
they have been spoken to on the subject. This is a mark of respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to which they are justly entitled. And are they not, from their
age, and experience, and affection, qualified to give advice? How
far it is binding on a young person to obey his or her parents, who
may disapprove of a proposed marriage, is a question which I shall
not presume to decide; but that no young person ought to give or
receive any inviolable pledge, till they have been solicited to give
their opinion and sanction, is a point too obvious to the dictates of
good sense and filial attachment, to need any lengthened discussion.
But how very rarely is this the case! An affection is formed and cherished&mdash;it
grows up into ardent and romantic attachment&mdash;interviews
take place&mdash;letters and presents are exchanged&mdash;and after the imagination
has been captivated with bright visions of future happiness,
the parents are requested to give their permission, not their advice.
If, now, they object, either from caprice, or from a full conviction
that the proposed union is improper or unsuitable, what direful
consequences often result! Their objections, in some cases, are
treated with scorn, and the marriage takes place in defiance of their
authority; and, in some instances, when their objections are admitted
to be valid, they are still doomed to see the fairest flower of their
family fade and die under the slow, yet fatal influence of a passion,
which is too strong to be quenched, and too baneful to be cherished.
These evils, which are so often springing up within the domestic
circle&mdash;destroying the peace and the happiness of parents and of
children, and setting at variance the members of the same household&mdash;might
be avoided, if, before adopting any decisive measures, the
parents&mdash;who have a right to expect such a mark of respect, who
have so much of their own respectability and happiness at issue,
and who are, in general, so well qualified to give judicious counsel&mdash;were
consulted.</p>

<p>But do not parents sometimes bring upon themselves, and upon
their children, the very evils which they are anxious to avoid? Do
they not, by their reserve&mdash;by their sternness&mdash;by their positive unwillingness
to admit their children into familiar intercourse, and by
their uniform habit of neglecting to encourage them to ask their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
advice in their different pursuits in life, indirectly compel them to
concealment, from the dread of a furious outbreak of passion? How
many a dutiful son has been known to say, "I would consult my
father, but he will not listen to my solicitation!" How many an
amiable daughter has said, on an offer being made her, "I should like
to take counsel from my parents, but they will not give it. They
will condemn my attachment without inquiry&mdash;without respecting
my feelings, and without assigning any reasons for their decision!"
Thus, the inexperienced child is often thrown on her own resources,
in reference to the most momentous step in life, in consequence of
being unable to apply for the advice of her parents; and dire necessity
compels her to profound secresy, till the fact of her attachment,
having been discovered by some accident, is heard with indignation.
An order to discontinue all further correspondence with the object
of her affection is now peremptorily issued, which merely serves to
increase the ardour of her attachment, and make her resolute in her
choice, without regard to consequences. Let parents, then, if they
wish to guide and control their children on these important occasions,
induce them to repose in them an implicit confidence&mdash;to consult
them, as friends, on every occasion of difficulty; and by the avoidance
of dictation, imperative command, or stern, unexplained prohibition,
endeavour to rule over them by a mild authority, tempered
with the purest affection; and, by a course of practical wisdom, in
assigning plain, palpable, and important reasons for the advice they
give, make it evident that they are influenced by a regard for their
children's welfare, rather than by mere caprice or an arbitrary will.
And though instances may occur in the history of human life, in
which such a wise method of procedure may fail in the accomplishment
of its object; and a perverse or reserved disposition may lead
the son or daughter to set at naught the kindest and best advice,
when given in the most unexceptionable manner; yet there is reason
to believe, that where parents have acted towards their children as
they ought to act, such a disastrous result will be of rare occurrence.</p>

<p>As we are commanded by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
to make known all our requests unto God, I cannot conceive
of any matter in which we ought to seek his direction more earnestly,
than in the choice of the person who is to be our companion
for life. He knows our tempers, our dispositions, and our propensities;
the future temptations and trials to which we shall be
subjected, and all the various ills that will intersect our path in
life; and he has promised, that if we acknowledge him in <em>all</em> our
ways, he will direct our steps. Ought we not to implore his guidance
in the selection of a suitable partner, to share our sorrows, and
enhance our joys?&mdash;one who will soothe us, under the agitations of
distress, tranquillize the irritation of passion, assist us by judicious
counsel, and who will give a higher tone to our character, by inducing
us to add to "virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance;
and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness,
brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity." But
how rarely is this duty attended to, even by those who make a profession
of religion, till they see one who captivates their heart; and
then the sanction of God is requested, rather than his counsel; and
he is importuned to remove the obstructions which impede the
gratification of our wishes, instead of being solicited to keep us from
forming an alliance which will be injurious to our happiness, our
usefulness, and our honour!</p>

<p>And are not Christian parents, in general, too inattentive to this
branch of their duty? Are they not, in the case of the marriage of
their children, apt to depend too much on their own judgment to
decide on its fitness? And are they not more frequently influenced
in their decision by the love of wealth, and of worldly respectability,
than by those moral and religious considerations, which ought ever
to maintain an absolute authority over them? As their own peace,
and the present and eternal happiness of their children, and their
children's children, depend so much on this important measure, they
ought often to pray, as their children are rising to maturity, that
he who fixes the bounds of our habitation, and determines for us the
number of our years on earth, would be pleased to form their connections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and sanctify their marriage by his blessing? Is it not by
the adoption of such a course of practical devotion, that parents are
encouraged to expect that their sons and their daughters will be preserved
"from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh
vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood:" and be
induced to form those alliances which will be no less a source of
happiness than of honour&mdash;handing down not only their names, but
their principles, their example, and their influence to bless and adorn
the succeeding generation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The intimacy which subsisted between Emma Holmes and her
young friend Miss Orme proved essentially injurious to the moral
tone and feelings of her mind; and eventually brought on the
family a series of trials which overwhelmed them in the deepest
sorrow. This intimacy commenced at school, just as her character
began to receive its complexion and its tendencies; and when she
stood most in need of those checks and restraints, and that salutary
advice, which she would have received, if her companion had been
imbued with the grace of pure religion. From the cast of her mind,
which bore no resemblance to that of either of her sisters, she
imbibed, at an early age, strong prejudices against evangelical piety;
and though at one period she felt the reproaches of an evil conscience,
and the terrors of the law falling upon her, yet she soon cast them
off, and became still more volatile and gay. The inconsistent conduct
of some professors was the immediate cause of effacing her deep and
solemn impressions of the vanity of the world and the importance
of religion; and though she would readily admit that this circumstance
was no valid argument against the reality of personal piety,
yet she could never conquer that painful aversion which it had
excited in her mind against the love of the truth.</p>

<p>This strong aversion was strengthened and increased by many accidental
circumstances, from which at the time no bad effects were apprehended.
Her sister Louisa had established a periodical interchange
of visits between her own family and the Corries, and their uncouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
phraseology of speech was no less offensive to Emma's taste, than
their dogmatic opinions were revolting to her moral feelings. Their
intellectual weakness imperceptibly destroyed that reverence for
the Christian faith which she had felt, when contemplating it as
associated with minds of a higher order, and greater degree of
refinement. Their perpetual recurrence to a few favourite opinions&mdash;the
tenacity with which they held them, even when fairly refuted
by sound argument&mdash;the self-complacency which they discovered in
their assumed superior illumination, after an unsuccessful effort to
support the dogmas of their belief&mdash;and the sang-froid with which
they condemned as unenlightened and unconverted every one who
professed sentiments differing from their own&mdash;excited in her mind
a great dislike to evangelical religion. While these good people
required from the chosen few a more entire renunciation of the world
than is compatible with its claims on our attention; and while they
visited with severe censures the slightest degree of conformity to its
style of dress or of living&mdash;condemning even a taste for music,
poetry, or art, as a proof of a carnal mind; they gave to the unconverted
the utmost latitude, and maintained that pious parents should
not attempt to impose any restrictions on their children, assigning
as a reason that if they were not elected to eternal life, this was the
only state in which they could enjoy happiness, and that to deprive
them of it by prohibiting them from "walking in the ways of their
own heart, and in the sight of their own eyes," would be an act of
cruelty and folly. In vain did Mr. Holmes argue, that secret things
belong to God, and the revealed promises and prohibitions to us
and to our children; they invariably met his arguments by saying,
that the mysteries of the kingdom were concealed from the wise
and the prudent, being revealed only to babes.</p>

<p>These speculative notions, if confined within their own pious
circle, would have done but little injury, but being introduced as
the theme of frequent discussion and debate in Emma's presence,
they supplied her with a powerful argument in justification of her
own predilections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this period, when her mind was vacillating between a
lingering reverence and a positive aversion to evangelical religion,
that she happened to pay a visit to Redhill, the seat of Colonel
Orme, her friend's father. Here she passed at once from the chastened
seriousness and fervent devotion of domestic order and piety,
to the levity and gaiety of fashionable life; and being removed from
the control of her parents, she devoted herself to worldly pleasures
and amusements with an ardour of feeling which bespoke the
energy of her ruling passion. The Colonel was a good-natured,
pleasant man; he had been gay in his younger days, but was now
become very domestic in his habits. He was a professed infidel; and
though he had too much politeness to make a direct attack upon
religion in Emma's presence, he nevertheless availed himself of every
favourable opportunity to lower it in her estimation. He related
facetious stories which had been got up for the purpose of burlesquing
the doctrines of the new birth, and salvation by grace&mdash;introduced
some grave tales to calumniate the conduct of the evangelical
clergy, and gave it as his decided opinion, that the fanaticism of
the country would destroy the energy and glory of the English
character.</p>

<p>Mrs. Orme was quite the lady of fashion, fond of dress and cards,
operas and balls; and as for Sunday, she was sometimes seen at
church, but then it was principally to show a mark of respect to the
clergyman, who was a particular friend of the Colonel's.</p>

<p>The Colonel had three daughters by his present wife, and one son
by a former marriage. As it required all his income to support
the style in which he lived, he could make no provision for his son
beyond the commission he had obtained for him in the army, yet he
flattered himself on being able to form for him some good alliance;
and understanding that Mr. Holmes was possessed of great wealth,
he resolved, if possible, to secure Emma as a partner for his son.
He broached the subject to his wife and eldest daughter, and both
agreed that the idea was most excellent.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Papa," said Miss Orme, "I think she is the very woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
for Charles. I am sure he will be captivated with her. Such
beauty, such elegance of manners, so much wit; and I should suppose,
from the style in which the Holmeses live, such a handsome
fortune."</p>

<p>"I don't look at beauty," said Mrs. Orme, "for that will fade;
nor at elegance of manners, for that obtains no distinction in the
present day; nor yet at wit, for that often brings people into
trouble; but I look at the fortune. Can you form any idea how
much she is likely to have? Have you ever spoken to her on the
subject?"</p>

<p>"O dear, yes, Mamma; I said to her one day, as we were walking
down the Green Lanes, just when we came opposite that beautiful
house, with the lawn and carriage sweep before it: 'I suppose,
Emma, nothing less than a carriage and four will please you,' at
which she smiled. I do think she expects a very handsome fortune."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said the Colonel, "these London citizens never retire
from business till they have feathered their nest very comfortably;
but they are, like old birds, rather wary, and we must be cautious
how we set the nets, or we shall not be able to catch the game. This
business requires management, and as I understand how to man&oelig;uvre
you must leave it to me. You women are too hasty in your
movements."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Mrs. Orme, "I don't care who takes the management
of the business, so that it is managed properly. But I must
suggest one idea before I have done, and that is, Emma herself had
better be asked the question, whether she is engaged, or has any
objection to the army."</p>

<p>"Yes, exactly so, Mamma. That idea struck me just now; and I
think it a most excellent one; and as we are to walk out in the
evening, I will propose it. I have no doubt but she will tell me;
and if, Papa, she feels any reluctance, I could argue the case with
her, and I have no doubt I should succeed. I am so delighted the
idea ever entered your mind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will each keep at your posts," said the Colonel, "and not
move or speak in this business till I give the word of command.
The first thing to be done is to ascertain if Charles will put off his
present engagement with Miss Collingwood, and the next is to see
whether he will take a fancy to Miss Holmes."</p>

<p>"Why, Colonel," said his wife, "I am surprised to hear you talk
so irrationally! Do you think he would hesitate breaking off that
engagement a single moment? Why, he said to me just before he
left home, 'I am apprehensive, from what I heard at the mess, that
Collingwood is not the man of wealth I thought he was when my
intimacy with his family commenced, and I must make more particular
inquiries.'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he won't object," said the Colonel, "though you know
it is a point of honour which every man can't pass; but as he has
passed it once, he may again."</p>

<p>In the evening, just before they sat down to cards, the Colonel
opened the campaign, by saying, "It is natural for every man to give
a decided preference to his own profession; but for my part, if I
were to begin life again, and had my choice, I would enter the army.
There it is a man acquires glory."</p>

<p>"And there it is," said Emma, "he is exposed to danger."</p>

<p>"Why, very true, Miss Holmes, but you know that the field of
danger is where the crown of honour is won!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what sacrifice of feeling does it require?"</p>

<p>"Why, very true, but you know feeling is rather sentimental!"</p>

<p>"Sentimental, Sir!" said the lively young lady, "and did you think
so when you received your wound in the head? It was then, I suspect,
felt to be real."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the Colonel, somewhat embarrassed, "very true;
but we don't pay much regard to feeling when engaged in the conflict."</p>

<p>"So I suppose; nor much regard to feeling in prospect of the conflict,
and still less when it is over."</p>

<p>"There you are mistaken; for before the battle begins, a death-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
horror comes over the most courageous spirit; but when it is
over, the shout of victory gives an ecstasy of delight."</p>

<p>"But how is it changed when you look round on the mangled
bodies of the slain&mdash;on your friends and comrades weltering in their
blood&mdash;or think of the wives and children whom the sword makes
widows and orphans!"</p>

<p>"Ah, true, that's the worst of it: but you know that wars and
fightings have been from the beginning, and will be to the end; and
some must engage in them."</p>

<p>"I presume," said Emma, addressing herself to Mrs. Orme, "you
must have felt intense agony of mind, every time the Colonel left
you for actual service!"</p>

<p>"At first I did, but after I got used to it, I did not regard it, for
use, you know, my dear, is second nature; and then there was so
much pleasure on his return."</p>

<p>"There is, certainly," said the Colonel, "some danger attending
the profession of arms; but it is the most honourable profession in
which a gentleman can be engaged; and though humanity may
shudder at sight of the evils attending it, yet a true soldier is one
of the most tender-hearted men living."</p>

<p>"Your eloquence, Sir," said Miss Emma, "brings to my recollection
what I once read:&mdash;'One murder makes a villain&mdash;a thousand
a hero;' and though you descant most feelingly on the tenderness of
a soldier's heart, you no doubt refer to it, when touched by the point
of the sword."</p>

<p>"Or," said the Colonel gallantly, "when pierced by a woman's
eye!"</p>

<p>Here the conversation ended, and they passed the evening at their
favourite game. "I fear," said Mrs. Orme, as soon as she found
herself alone with her husband, "she has no predilection for the
profession; and if so, our hopes are blasted."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, she has, only she has thrown up a masked battery in
her own defence; but when Charles comes, you will see with what
ease he will destroy it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after this conversation, Colonel and Mrs. Orme entertained
a large party at dinner, at which a brilliant company of fashionable
friends and acquaintances was present. As this was the first
party that had been invited during her visit, Emma bestowed a more
than ordinary attention on her personal appearance. Her dress, if
not expensive, was elegant, and though there were other ladies who
surpassed her in the richness of their attire, there was no one who
equalled her in the beauty of her figure, or the grace and elegance
of her movements. She now felt herself, for the first time in her life,
in a position which gave her an opportunity of displaying her attractions,
which she did with so much grace, that she excited the envy
and admiration of the company, who were astonished when they
heard that this was the daughter of Mr. Holmes. In the course of
the evening the rumble of wheels was heard at the door, and soon
after a handsome young man entered the drawing-room, whom
Emma at once perceived to be Charles Orme, on his parents and
sister hastening forward to meet him. He had just got leave of
absence, he said, for a few weeks, and sooner than he expected, which
had brought him to Redhill, without previously sending any notice.
Emma was quite charmed with his appearance, and still more so
when the Colonel, walking up to her, said, "Allow me, Miss Holmes,
to introduce to you my son Charles&mdash;Charles, Miss Emma Holmes.</p>

<p>"This is an unlooked-for pleasure, Miss Holmes," said Captain
Orme, performing his part in the ceremony of the introduction with
the most polished gallantry; "I have often heard of you from my
sister in her letters. What charming weather this is! Pray, may
I have you as a partner, as I see they are getting up a quadrille?"</p>

<p>Emma gracefully consented; and from that moment her destiny
in life was fixed. On the other hand, Captain Orme was quite
struck with her beauty; and though the apparent heartiness of
his manner, at his first introduction, was merely the result of that
vanity which seeks to engross for itself the company of the most
elegant woman present, he could not help experiencing, even in his
cold and selfish heart, a somewhat deeper and more serious feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
as he conversed with this young and beautiful girl. Colonel and
Mrs. Orme viewed, with great satisfaction, the evident impression
made on their son by Emma's beauty; and, accordingly, after their
guests had departed, they communicated to him the matrimonial
speculation they had in view for him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FIRST MEETING OF CAPTAIN ORME AND EMMA HOLMES.</p>

<p>Vol. ii. p. 352.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I am sure, Charles," said his father, "there could not be a more
desirable match: youth, beauty, and last, not least (with a significant
leer), a very handsome fortune."</p>

<p>"Has she her fortune at her own command?" asked his son.</p>

<p>"Why, no, the wealth of the Holmes family has all been accumulated
by the old man; and I should suppose the amount of this girl's
fortune must be dependent on his will. But he will, doubtless, give
her a handsome portion, if he is satisfied with the match."</p>

<p>"Now, that is just the difficulty," said Mrs. Orme. "The family,
always strong Evangelicals, have lately turned Dissenters, because,
forsooth, Mr. Vaughan's sermons are not sufficiently methodistical
to please them. Mr. Holmes has a great prejudice against the military
profession, as one both of a questionable nature in itself, and
beset with numerous temptations. We must, then, play our cards
well, and act with caution."</p>

<p>"The first thing," said the Colonel, "is for you, Charles, to pay
your addresses to Miss Holmes. I do not think there will be much
difficulty with <em>her</em>."</p>

<p>"Well, I should rather suppose there would not," replied the
modest youth, contemplating, with considerable satisfaction, his
elegant figure in the mirror over the drawing-room chimney-piece;
"it shall not be my fault if she does not become Mrs. Orme. But
good night. I was up all last night at Lady Fortescue's ball, and
must be off to bed."</p>

<p>"One word, Charles," said his mother, "what are you going to do
with Miss Collingwood?"</p>

<p>"O, that has all been over for some time. I learned that her
father has nothing to depend on but his pay, and that his daughter's
fortune, left her by an aunt, amounts only to three thousand pounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
and is so tied up, that I should never be able to touch a shilling of
it. So I am well out of that affair."</p>

<p>The Captain was a young man about the age of twenty-five. He
had inherited from his mother a handsome fortune, which he received
on coming of age; but such had been his profuse extravagance, before
and after he entered the army, that when he had paid his
so-called debts of honour, and the Jew brokers who had advanced
him money, he found himself unable to defray the bills of his tradesmen,
who were clamorous for the settlement of their accounts.
Various were the expedients which he employed to keep them from
carrying their threats into execution; and at length he resolved on
marriage, as the only alternative he could devise, to extricate himself
from his embarrassments. He first paid his addresses to the eldest
daughter of a country gentleman, but soon quitted her on ascertaining
the small amount of fortune which she possessed. A similar reason, as
above-mentioned, induced him to desert Miss Collingwood, the daughter
of a retired major in the Indian army; and now he prepared
to pay his addresses to the more accomplished and the more wealthy
daughter of Mr. Holmes. He, of course, concealed from the latter
the history of his former life, spoke of the fortune which fell to him
by the death of his mother, as though it were still in his possession,
and assured her that he had no other motive in view than the honour
and felicity of being permitted to call her his wife. Unaccustomed
to the duplicity of the world, and fudging of others, from the integrity
of her own heart, she listened to his overtures with pleasure,
and though she proposed speaking to her parents before she ventured
to give any decisive reply, yet this was overruled by Mrs. Orme, who
suggested the expediency of deferring it for the present. "You know,
my dear," said the intriguing woman, "your Papa and Mamma, from
their peculiar sentiments on religion, may feel some objection to
Charles's profession, and it will be necessary to adopt some plan to
reconcile them to it; and, as an opening has now been made, the
Colonel and I both think that we had better establish a close intimacy
with the Elms, before anything is said on the subject."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>On her return home, she intermingled with the family as usual,
preserved the same degree of decorum in her attention to religious
duties, and at times appeared thoughtful and sedate, which induced
her unsuspecting sister to imagine that she was beginning to feel the
deep impressions of religion on her heart. Amidst all her gaiety,
and sprightliness, and aversion to decided piety, she had always displayed
an honest frankness when speaking on the subject, but now
she had a part to act which required duplicity; and having been
tutored to this vice at the Colonel's, she soon became a proficient.
As her sister Louisa had made some reference to her comparative
sedateness, and expressed, in very delicate terms, her hope that it
was the beginning of the great change, she resolved to assume a
more uniform gravity of manner, that she might more effectually
conceal the passion which had taken such strong hold of her feelings.
She made no allusion to the scenes of gaiety she had recently witnessed,
and in which she moved as one of the most admired figures;
nor did she express any wish to repeat her visit, which rather tended
to confirm the hopes of her sister.</p>

<p>"Jane and I," said Miss Holmes, as they were all rising from the
dinner table, "are going to see Mrs. Kent; will you accompany us,
Emma?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I long to see the old lady. She is a real Christian,
I have no doubt; and if her mind had received the same degree of
cultivation as her heart, she would have exhibited the majesty and
force no less than the amiable traits of religion."</p>

<p>"I was not aware," replied Miss Holmes, with a smile of pleasure,
"that you ever associated such qualities with the pure religion of
Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"O yes, I do; and I am delighted when I see them embodied in a
living character; but they must be blended to produce their full
effect."</p>

<p>"But is not the beauty of religion more attractive than its
grandeur?"</p>

<p>"It may be so to some persons, but not to me. I prefer a mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
that can discourse on the doctrines of Christianity in a style of
speech which bears some analogy to their sublime greatness."</p>

<p>"I hope, dear Emma," said Miss Holmes, "you do not now feel
that strong antipathy to the Corries which you have heretofore
manifested; for though they are weak Christians, yet you must
acknowledge they are pious."</p>

<p>"Yes, they may be pious," replied Emma, with some sarcastic
warmth of manner; "but who that has any feeling of respect for
the honour of Christianity does not regret that their piety is not
confined to a cloister? Mrs. Kent exhibits the beauty of religion,
the Corries its deformity: Mrs. Kent would make an infidel believe,
but the Corries would make a Christian doubt; she, by the artless
simplicity of her instructions, would</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">... 'rear the tender thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teach the young idea how to shoot;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">till the principle of grace grows up laden with the fruits of righteousness;
they, by their vanity and self-conceit, their dogmatism, and
perverse obstinacy of opinion, would shake the strongest faith.
Or, to speak in plain terms, such Christians as the Corries should
never speak on religious subjects in the presence of the irreligious;
for if they do, they will confirm the enmity which they wish to
subdue, and give a degree of encouragement to sin which they do
not intend."</p>

<p>The old woman had just finished reading a letter when the young
ladies entered her cottage; and though she received them with her
usual kind manner, yet she could not conceal the powerful agitation
of her feelings.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Miss Holmes, "we are not intruding."</p>

<p>"No, Miss, I am very glad to see you; and I hope you will not
allow my distress to give you any trouble."</p>

<p>"O," said Emma, "if you are in trouble let us know the cause of
it; though I ought to apologize for having asked such an impertinent
question."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"The question is not impertinent, and therefore I beg you will
say nothing about an apology. I have just received a letter from
my dear boy, who has been absent from me these fourteen years,
and as I had not heard from him for many months I thought
he was dead."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He is with his regiment at the Cape of Good Hope, very ill in
the hospital, and says he does not expect that I shall ever hear from
him again. He was once a good, obedient son, much attached to his
mother, but he fell into evil company, and was enticed to enlist as a
soldier. He said nothing to me about it for many days after he had
done it, or I could have got him off by speaking to Squire Ridgeway;
but I did not know anything about it till the night before he was
marched off, and since then I have never seen him; and now he is
confined in the hospital so far off that I can't go to nurse him, nor
speak to him about the Saviour who came into the world to save
sinners. I hope you will excuse me, ladies, but a mother can't help
weeping."</p>

<p>While the poor old woman was telling this affecting tale, the
countenance of Emma underwent very perceptible changes, from
the deep crimson blush to a deathlike paleness, till, overpowered
by her feelings, she fainted in the arms of her sister. She was taken
into the open air, and various expedients were adopted to restore
her, which after a short time proved successful. "Dear creature,"
said Mrs. Kent, fanning her, "she has a tender heart, and can't bear
to hear of another's sorrows. I am grieved that I said anything
about my affliction, it has proved too much for her."</p>

<p>"She has," Miss Holmes remarked, "a great esteem for you, which
is the cause of her having felt so great an interest in your calamity;
but she will soon be better."</p>

<p>On recovering, she expressed her regret that the weakness of her
nerves should occasion so much trouble; and having taken a draught
of water, she rose, and leaning on the arms of her sisters, soon after
walked home. During the evening she endeavoured to resume her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
usual cheerfulness, but she could not, and dreading a recurrence of
the fit, she complained of indisposition, and retired to rest. In the
morning, when her sister Louisa went into her room, she found her
in a sweet sleep; and, as she was stealing away, she saw a miniature
lying on her dressing-table, and on looking at it thought it bore a
strong resemblance to Captain Orme, who, after Emma's return
home, had one day called with his sister.</p>

<p>The following day Mr. and Mrs. Holmes were surprised by a call
from the Colonel and Miss Orme, who came to invite them to meet
a select dinner party; and, though they had resolved not to intermix
with the gay world, yet they knew not how to refuse such an
expression of politeness, especially as they had been so kind to
Emma. They therefore consented.</p>

<p>"Mamma requested me," said Miss Orme to her young friend,
"to offer you the loan of this book, which she thinks you will like.
<em>It is a very religious one. You may open it at your leisure.</em>"</p>

<p>The emphasis which was placed on this sentence, viewed in connection
with the miniature painting, awakened the suspicion of Miss
Holmes, who now believed that some secret correspondence was
going on between her sister and Captain Orme; and an accidental
occurrence took place in the course of the day, which removed every
doubt from her mind. Emma on taking her handkerchief out of her
reticule, as she was retiring from the parlour after dinner, dropped
a letter, which her mother picked up, and read. She immediately
presented it to Mr. Holmes, who also read it. This was a letter
which Mrs. Orme had inclosed between the leaves of the book she
had sent to Emma, informing her that Charles was well, and wanted
to meet her that evening, at Mrs. Paton's. She added that she
hoped she had contrived to keep all at the Elms ignorant of the
affair, as the Colonel was still of opinion that they should not be
spoken to on the business till everything was properly arranged.</p>

<p>This letter, which explained the obscure parts of Emma's conduct,
involved the whole family in great perplexity; and they were at
a loss to know what course to pursue, that would save her from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
snares which had been laid to entrap her. At length it was resolved
to replace the letter, and leave the room. This was done, and on
passing through the hall, Mr. Holmes met her, and said,</p>

<p>"I am going, my dear, to take a ride in the carriage this afternoon,
will you go with me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Papa."</p>

<p>On entering the parlour she found her letter, and eagerly seized
it, presuming that it had escaped detection.</p>

<p>She had given her promise to accompany her father when her
feelings were strongly excited by the dread of having Mrs. Orme's
letter to her discovered; but now she began to complain of indisposition,
and wished to decline the proposed ride. However, her
objections were overruled, and she went.</p>

<p>On the following morning, her father, finding her alone, took the
opportunity of alluding to his anxiety for her spiritual and temporal
welfare, and hoped that she would take no important step in life
without the advice and approbation of her parents.</p>

<p>"Do you think it possible, Papa, that I could be so unwise or
so undutiful as to take any important step without consulting
you?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, my dear child," said her father, taking her by the hand,
"have you not already been induced to do so, and that by the persuasion
of others?"</p>

<p>This question, proposed in the mildest accents, and with every
expression of parental tenderness, staggered and confounded her,
and, after a momentary pause, she fell on her knees and implored
forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Yes, my father, I have been induced to act a part which I
sincerely regret. Forgive me, I beseech you."</p>

<p>She frankly confessed the whole plot; offered to return every
letter and present she had received, and promised that she would
never suffer herself to be again beguiled from the path of duty.
These presents Mr. Holmes sent back to the Colonel's, accompanied
by the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Since your call on Thursday morning, I have detected the
intimacy which has been formed between my daughter and your
son; and am surprised that you and Mrs. Orme should so far forget
the obligations which are due to a parent, as to dissuade my child
from consulting me on a measure of so much importance to our
happiness, and her own. Had the young people resolved to practise
this species of deception on me without your knowledge or consent,
I should blame them only; but as this plot has been got up by you,
I must say, that the amount of their fault is lost in the greater
magnitude of yours; and I have no doubt but your object is to
repair the ruined fortune of your son at the expense of my daughter's
happiness. You will therefore allow me to say, that all intimacy
between our families has ceased.&mdash;Yours," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>After this abrupt termination of an intimacy which had opened
before her the prospect of a connection for life, she appeared for
a few days relieved from an oppressive burden of anxiety, and was
assiduous in her attention to her parents; but her appearance and
her manners soon proved that her affections were entangled, and
that nothing but time and the tenderest treatment on their part
could disengage them. She became low and dejected&mdash;careless of her
person&mdash;unwilling to mingle in any company&mdash;the healthful bloom
of her countenance passed away, succeeded by the sickly and pallid
hue; she seldom took part in conversation, and endeavoured
to avoid all intercourse with the other members of the family.
At length her mother became much alarmed, and said it was her
opinion, that unless they consented to a renewal of the intimacy
with the Ormes, they must prepare to follow their daughter to the
grave. "I never can give my consent to the connection," said Mr.
Holmes; "and would rather follow her to the grave than see her
united to such a person. Captain Orme is a man who has squandered
his fortune; destroyed the strength of his constitution by
dissolute habits; is involved in debt by his extravagance; and
would sacrifice the happiness, and even the life of Emma, with as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
little remorse as he now feels for his past crimes. He is bad, but his
parents, if possible, are worse; for they have not only given the sanction
of their approbation to his conduct, but attempted to corrupt
our child, and thus ruin our domestic happiness."</p>

<p>The conduct of a female, who accepts the addresses of a gentleman
without consulting her parents, or her guardians, is deserving
of censure; but when she is beguiled into the measure by the entreaties
and persuasion of others, and especially those who have
children or wards of their own, the voice of censure should reserve
its severest expressions of reprobation for her tempters and seducers.
Their delinquency, it is true, does not cancel hers, but it offers some
slight degree of extenuation. What evils often result from that
system of man&oelig;uvring, which is so much tolerated, nay, even applauded,
in society! These match-makers and busy-bodies&mdash;these
common nuisances and pests&mdash;who trample on all the sacred principles
of honour and of friendship, and display such indifference when
detected&mdash;ought to be excluded from every family which wishes to
preserve the honour and happiness of its female members. Nor
ought we to hold in less detestation and abhorrence, the conduct of
those who allow our children to hold secret and forbidden intercourse
with each other at their houses, or consent to become the
agents through whom a correspondence is carried on. Such persons
may express their tender sympathy for the young people who are
not permitted to meet openly and in the face of day, and may pass
some heavy censures on the cruelty of their parents; but can they,
on reflection, approve of their own doings, and think themselves
entitled to respect? Impossible! They are acting a part over which
they wish the veil of secrecy to be thrown; and, often sacrificing
on the same altar the virtue and happiness of the child, with the
peace and honour of the parent, can offer no other apology for their
conduct, than that "they did not mean any harm."</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes saw, with great anxiety, the declining health of his
beloved Emma; and on surprising her, in tears, one morning as he
entered her room, he expressed his fears that she was unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my father, I am unhappy; and I believe that I shall never
see another happy day in this unhappy world."</p>

<p>"But I understood, when I spoke to you on the subject, that it was
your determination to renounce all further thoughts of Captain Orme."</p>

<p>"Yes, I said I would return his letters, and never suffer myself
to be again beguiled from the path of duty; but I cannot subdue
my feelings. I think if you knew him you would not object."</p>

<p>"My dear girl, I have strong objections to his profession, which
is not favourable to the cultivation of those domestic virtues on
which the happiness of a wife depends."</p>

<p>"But, Papa, he is one of the most attentive and amiable of men;
and would, I have no doubt, make me happy."</p>

<p>"It is very rarely, indeed, that a rake ever makes a good husband."</p>

<p>"A rake! Papa; you are misinformed."</p>

<p>"Ah, my child, you are not aware of the deception which has been
practised on you, by those you once thought, and perhaps still think,
your friends. I have made the most minute inquiry respecting his
habits, his property, and his character; and I can assure you, on
evidence the most decisive, that he is dissolute in his habits&mdash;impoverished
in his fortune&mdash;and his general character is the very reverse
of what you imagine."</p>

<p>"O Papa! I think you have been deceived. He has his mother's
fortune, which is very handsome. I have seen the original deeds
which secured it to him."</p>

<p>"He had his mother's fortune, my dear, but he squandered it away
before he came of age; and when it was actually transferred to him,
it was not sufficient to pay all his debts."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Papa, that you are not misinformed?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure, my dear Emma."</p>

<p>"And may I be permitted to ask, how you gained this information,
which is so contrary to every statement I have received; and which,
if true, must change my opinion of him?"</p>

<p>"I gained it, in the first instance, through the medium of your
brothers; but as I was unwilling to believe such an unfavourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
account, even on their testimony, I obtained a personal interview
with several of his creditors, who gave me ocular proof of the correctness
of their statements. Indeed, one of them arrested him last
week, for the sum of twenty pounds, which had been due more than
a year and a half; and others have been induced to wait a few months
longer, from the representations of the Colonel, who has told them
that his son is just on the eve of marrying a wealthy citizen's daughter,
when every claim shall be settled."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Such treachery cannot dwell in the human bosom!"</p>

<p>"It is true, my child."</p>

<p>"I am forced to believe it, Papa, and yet I cannot. Perhaps it is
only a temporary embarrassment, arising from some act of generosity,
or some species of fraud, that has been practised on him. And
you know, Papa, a gentleman who is reduced to poverty, may rise
again in society; and gaining wisdom by his experience, he may
become more careful."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, if he be a man of probity and virtue; but if not,
he will never rise."</p>

<p>"And is not Charles Orme a man of probity and virtue?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say he is not. He may appear such in your presence,
and he may be described as such by his own family, but when
his mode of life is inquired into, he will be found frequenting places
and societies which a virtuous man would shun as offensive to his
taste, and destructive of his honour."</p>

<p>When a forbidden passion has once gained an ascendency over the
mind of a female, it very often throws such a spell around her, that
she becomes either unable or unwilling to see the inevitable ruin
that lies before her; and though she will listen to the advice of her
friends with apparent interest, and sometimes profess to adopt it,
under a full conviction that it is such as she ought to follow, yet as
soon as she comes into contact with the fatal object on which her
affections are irrecoverably placed, she feels an influence which destroys
all her wise resolves, and hurries her to her doom.</p>

<p>Thus it was with the infatuated Emma, who, after struggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
with her affections for many months, and endeavouring to recover
that mental peace which she formerly enjoyed, rashly determined to
follow the impulse of her will, though her ruin should be the inevitable
consequence.</p>

<p>The family had accepted an invitation to spend a few days with
an intimate friend, who resided near Tunbridge Wells, but as Emma
did not wish to go into company at present, she was excused, and
took leave of her parents and sisters with the tenderest expressions
of attachment, and said she hoped they would enjoy the visit. On
their return they were informed by the housekeeper that Miss Emma
had not been home since the day after they left, but had requested
her to present the following letter to her father as soon as she saw
him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Father</span>,&mdash;Before you receive this, I shall have committed
an act which will plunge you and every one of our family
into the greatest distress; but I have been compelled to it by dire
necessity. I could not conquer my passion for Captain Orme, and
am therefore now his wife. Had I not consented, my life would
have fallen a sacrifice to my feelings; and as I am not prepared to
die, I judged it prudent to perpetuate a life, with some chance for
happiness, rather than lose it, with a certain prospect of misery.
I hope you and my dear mother will forgive me; and if you cannot
suffer me to visit you, I hope you will pray for me. My present
home is at the Colonel's, and though I do not expect to find it such
a one as that which I have left, yet I trust it will not be without
its comforts. With every affectionate regard to you, my dear Mamma,
and sisters, and brothers, I am your undutiful, yet much attached,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Emma</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<h2>A SEQUEL TO THE FOREGOING.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_392.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The distress into which the Holmes' family were
plunged, on hearing the contents of the letter just referred
to, exceeds all description; and though, during
the first ebullition of their grief, they gave utterance to
heavy censures and bitter reproaches, yet, on cooler reflection, they
felt more disposed to pity than blame the poor deluded Emma. "A
deceived heart," said her father, "hath led her astray, and she needs
not the vial of our displeasure to fill up the bitter cup which she
has to drink. We, as a family, have had," he continued, "a larger
proportion of happiness for a long series of years than has fallen
to the lot of most; and if, in the decline of life, it should please an
all-wise Providence to cast over us the clouds of sorrow, we must
not repine, but rather bow in submission to his righteous will, and
pray for wisdom and for grace, to guide and support us, when
walking through the darkness by which we are now surrounded."</p>
</div>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Holmes, "this is an evil which I did not expect.
I thought she had too much regard for her own honour,
and too much respect for our feelings, to steal away from us in
such a clandestine manner, as though her home were a prison, and
her parents tyrants. She deserves all she may suffer; and if she
has not become as callous as a rock, must endure a martyrdom of
anguish."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, but she is still our child; and though she has torn
herself away from us, we must not abandon her."</p>

<p>"Abandon her! no, impossible! I can never forget that I gave
her birth; that I watched over her in infancy and childhood; and
that she was the pride of my heart in my old age. It is the strength
of my affection that gives me such intense pain when I think of her
ungrateful conduct."</p>

<p>Her clothes, &amp;c., were carefully packed up, and sent to Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Orme's, according to her own request, accompanied by the following
letter, which inclosed a draft on her father's banker for Â£50:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Emma</span>,&mdash;I shall not attempt to describe our consternation
when on returning home we received your letter, which informed
us of the step you have taken. To reproach you, now the deed is
done, will not repair the evil, nor will it afford any alleviation to our
distress. We hope you may be happy, and may meet that kindness
from your new connections, which you, no doubt, have anticipated;
but which we do not expect. I have inclosed a draft for
your <em>own use</em>, as a token of my affection, and assure you that you
will always meet with a welcome reception at the Elms, when
you choose to visit us; but you must come alone. As you are
now an inmate in a family which makes no profession of religion, I
fear you will be exposed to temptations, which will efface every
devout impression you have received; and you may be induced
to treat with indifference, if not with contempt, the faith in which
you have been educated. Remember, my dear child, that the fashion
of this world is passing away, and that in a few years you will have
to stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and if, in that solemn
and awful moment, you should be separated from us, by the impassable
gulf, with what feelings will you await your sentence! We
will pray for you; but our prayers will be useless unless <em>you</em> likewise
pray, and repent, and believe the gospel.&mdash;I remain your affectionate
father,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">H. Holmes</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Her husband took this draft to the bank and got it cashed, but he
kept the money; and when his wife ventured to ask him for it, he
requested her to apply to her father for more. This she refused
to do, which drew from him the first unkind expression she had
heard him utter. As the news of his marriage spread abroad, his
creditors became very clamorous for the settlement of their accounts;
and though by dexterous man&oelig;uvring, he contrived to keep
them from adopting any violent measures, yet he felt conscious
that the crisis was fast approaching, unless Mr. Holmes could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
persuaded to assist him. He made a contrite apology to his wife
for the unguarded language he had used&mdash;pledged his honour never
more to wound her feelings&mdash;and assured her that nothing but dire
necessity had induced him to appropriate the money to his own use,
which was designed exclusively for hers. She accepted the apology,
but felt startled by his allusion to pecuniary embarrassment, though
she felt the subject to be too delicate to notice.</p>

<p>Her husband's family treated her with the utmost degree of
respect and affection, and every one strove to promote her happiness.
Captain Orme was unremitting in his attentions, studied her gratification
in all his arrangements, and conducted himself with so
much propriety, that she flattered herself with the prospect of enjoying
a large portion of conjugal felicity. Six months had now
passed away without any fresh interruption to her happiness, when
she began to perceive a fixed gloom on the countenance of her husband,
who absented himself more frequently, and for a longer space
of time than he had been accustomed to do; and she heard some
ambiguous expressions from her father and mother-in-law, which
she knew not how to explain; nor would her high spirit suffer her
to ask an explanation. At length, one day the Colonel informed
her that some application must be made to her father for a settlement,
as his son's pay was not equal to the expenses of the family
which he was now likely to have.</p>

<p>"Captain Orme informed me, Sir, when he solicited me to leave
my father's house to become his wife, and you assured me that his
statement was correct, that his fortune was large, and that it was
quite immaterial to him whether my father gave me a fortune or
left me penniless."</p>

<p>"I deny it, Madam, and now tell you that your husband is
in embarrassed circumstances, and it is useless to conceal the fact
any longer. Something must be done, or you are both ruined."</p>

<p>"No gentleman, Sir, ever ventured to suspect the truth of my
testimony, and I am sorry that I ever gave you an opportunity
to do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, I beg your pardon for the abruptness of my reply.
Perhaps I did say that his statement was correct; but to be frank,
he is in difficulties, and we must endeavour to get him out as well
as we can; and no one has so much at stake in this business as
yourself."</p>

<p>"If his difficulties have come upon him since our marriage I will
submit to any privation, and will take upon myself any task to
extricate him; but if they existed before, I do not know that it is in
my power to forgive an act of deception so cruel and unjust as that
which you have all practised upon me."</p>

<p>"You talk," said the Colonel, "like one who lived before the fall,
in a state of paradisiacal innocence, rather than like one who has
seen the world as it is. The world is governed by deception; in
church, in state, in all the departments of social life; and if you
have been deceived by any statements which might have been given
to allure you to the altar, we have all been deceived since your
return from it."</p>

<p>"Not by me, Sir."</p>

<p>"No, Madam, but by your father."</p>

<p>"My father! no! impossible! As he is too humane to reproach,
he is too sincere to deceive."</p>

<p>"Why, we all expected, when the marriage was over, that he
would provide handsomely for you."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that he will, ultimately, but I never gave you
any reason to expect it."</p>

<p>"But we <em>did</em> expect it, and I think we have a <em>right</em> to expect it.
Can he suppose that my son is to meet all the expenses which you
and your family may bring upon him, without receiving some
assistance! If he do, he is deceived, and will entail on you and
himself disgrace and misery."</p>

<p>"But you know, Colonel," said Mrs. Orme, "it is no use to wound
the feelings of dear Emma so much. If Charles is in trouble, I
know she will do what she can to assist him, without being very
particular respecting the cause of his difficulties; and I would propose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
without any farther remarks on this very painful question,
that she write to her father on the subject, or give her consent for
you to write."</p>

<p>"What are his difficulties?" inquired Emma.</p>

<p>"O dear, only a small account which he is obliged to pay immediately."</p>

<p>"And cannot he pay a small account?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, he has had to settle several lately, which has
taken from him all his ready money."</p>

<p>"How much is this small account?"</p>

<p>"O, only about Â£200."</p>

<p>"And do you consider this a trifling sum to owe one tradesman?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear, for a gentleman of his profession."</p>

<p>"Well," said Emma, "I will have some conversation with Charles
on the subject when he returns; and we will decide on the adoption
of some plan."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, I am sorry to inform you, that he is at present
detained by the formalities of the law."</p>

<p>"Detained by the formalities of the law! I do not understand
you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but he cannot return home till the money is paid
or some security is given that it shall be paid."</p>

<p>"Then, where is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, it will afford you no pleasure if I tell you. You
had better not press the question."</p>

<p>"But I must press the question; and I must request to know
where he is."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, since you must have it, the gentleman who waited
on him for the payment of the money, has very kindly given him
permission to stay in his house till it is paid."</p>

<p>"What! is he in prison?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly in prison; only the formalities of the law require
that he should remain with the gentleman till the money is
paid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can I see him?"</p>

<p>"Why, you had better not. You had better write to your father
on the business, or let the Colonel write."</p>

<p>"Then let the Colonel write, for I can never consent to tell such
a tale to my father, after having treated his remonstrances with so
much contempt; and violating my most solemn pledge, that I would
never suffer myself to be beguiled again from the path of duty."</p>

<p>The Colonel wrote to Mr. Holmes, requesting that he would give
his daughter some portion of her fortune; delicately hinting at the
temporary embarrassments of her husband; soliciting, at the same
time, the honour of an interview, when he had no doubt, but some
expedient could be devised to bring about a friendly reconciliation,
by which the happiness of both families might be placed on a substantial
basis. To this letter Mr. Holmes replied, that he felt it his
duty to make every provision in his power for the personal comfort
of his daughter; but no circumstances should induce him to pay the
enormous debts which he knew her husband had contracted by a
course of extravagant profligacy; and while he was willing to admit
her under his roof, it was not his intention ever to form the most
distant intimacy with a family who had acted with such cruel duplicity
towards his child, and sacrificed her happiness for life.</p>

<p>On the receipt of this letter, the Ormes were thrown into the
greatest degree of perplexity; and though they did not read it to
Emma, because it contained some severe reflections on their conduct,
yet they judged it expedient to inform her, that Mr. Holmes refused
to comply with their request. "You must now, my dear, apply for
some cash," said Mrs. Orme, "as you will soon want many conveniences,
which it will not be in Charles's power to procure, and I would
advise you to press for a generous remittance." This application,
however, was rendered unnecessary, as a few days afterwards, she
received a letter from her father, inclosing a draft for Â£30 for her
own use, and informing her, that if she preferred being confined at
the Elms, everything was ready for her reception.</p>

<p>She now began to see the extreme delicacy of her situation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
to feel the direful consequences of her own imprudence; but she had
no friend in whom she could confide or who could sympathize with
her misfortunes. Her mind was in a state of perpetual anxiety,
often deeply wounded by the neglect, or unkind looks and expressions
of those who once professed the utmost degree of affection&mdash;with
the near prospect, too, of becoming a mother, without a home,
or any provision for herself or child, except by returning to her
father's house&mdash;a step which she contemplated at present with
extreme reluctance.</p>

<p>After an absence of several days, Captain Orme returned home
in high spirits, informing his wife that he had had an interview
with her father, who very generously forgave him, and drew a check
on his banker for Â£300. "Now," said the Captain, "I'll give you a
proof of my honour. I'll take you to the bank, you shall receive
the cash, and pay yourself the Â£50, which necessity compelled me
to appropriate to my own use."</p>

<p>"No, Charles," replied his wife, "if my father has forgiven you,
so will I; and still indulge the hope, that our union, which has been
embittered with grief, may yet prove a source of mutual felicity. I
request that no further allusion be made to the money."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I cannot be happy unless you allow me to redeem my
honour, which stands pledged to you for it. You must consent to
take it, and I'll accompany you to the bank. You will wound me
if you make another objection."</p>

<p>She entertained no doubt of the truth of his statement; and they
accordingly drove to town together the following morning. Just as
they were going into the bank, he said, "There's a friend whom I
have been anxious to see some months; you will step in and get the
cash, and after I have seen him, I will return and meet you."</p>

<p>As she was well known to one of the partners in the banking firm,
who had often visited at the Elms, the check was honoured without
much inspection; and having the money, she gave her husband
Â£250, and then begged his acceptance of the Â£50, as an expression
of her attachment. With this sum he paid the debt for which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
was arrested; and prevented another arrest which he had been daily
expecting.</p>

<p>Things now wore a brighter aspect, and the unsuspecting Emma
was induced to decline accepting her father's offer; choosing to be
confined at the Colonel's, where she could enjoy the society of her
husband, without giving any trouble to the members of her own
family. Though often pressed to pay a visit to the Elms, she had
always deferred doing so; but she now proposed a visit to express
the pleasure she felt in prospect of a reconciliation between the two
families. On mentioning this, however, to her husband, he urged
her not to do it till after her confinement, saying, "The heir will be
our advocate, and heal the breach." The eventful time drew near,
and everything necessary for the occasion had been sent, with a
pressing invitation to spend a few weeks at home, as soon as she was
capable of doing so.</p>

<p>"I am happy to inform you," said her husband, a few weeks after
the occurrences above narrated, "that I have had another interview
with your father; after expressing his good wishes for your welfare,
and requesting that I would accompany you to the Elms after your
convalescence, he very generously said, that as our expenses just
now must be very heavy, and he wished you to have the best professional
advice, and every comfort that money could procure, he
would beg my acceptance of this check for Â£400. Now, my dear
Emma, we will go to town in the morning, and you shall get the
cash, and do what you like with it." This was accordingly done in
the course of the following day.</p>

<p>At night the family retired to rest as usual; but about midnight
they were disturbed, and ere day-break the birth of a fine boy was
announced. The news was immediately despatched to the Elms,
with a particular request from Mrs. Charles Orme, that her sister
Louisa would come to see her. The interview was interesting and
affecting; for though the two sisters bore no resemblance to each
other in taste or in disposition, yet their attachment was mutual;
and increased on this occasion by the influence of misfortune and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
sorrow. Miss Holmes remained at Redhill nearly three weeks;
and on her return, when detailing the incidents of her visit, she
referred to her father's generosity to Captain Orme.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear," said Mr. Holmes, "I have done nothing which
has not been previously agreed upon by us."</p>

<p>"Why, father, it is very good in you to speak so of your generosity
to Captain Orme. We were rather surprised, however, at your not
even mentioning to us that you had seen him."</p>

<p>"I have not seen Captain Orme since the day of his marriage,
and I am at a loss to conceive to what acts of generosity you
refer."</p>

<p>"Not seen him, Papa! why, have you not given him two drafts
on your banker, for a considerable amount?"</p>

<p>"I never did anything of the kind! You must be dreaming,
Louisa."</p>

<p>"Emma informed me that you had; and that she went, at her
husband's urgent request, and got them cashed."</p>

<p>"Then he has forged my check; and again imposed on the credulity
of our dear child."</p>

<p>He immediately rode off to his banker's, and found forged checks
to the amount of Â£700. This discovery involved the family in great
distress; but they resolved not to take any steps in the business till
they had seen Emma, which they expected to do in the course of a
few days. On the morning she left for the Elms, Captain Orme requested
that she would make no allusion to her father's generosity,
as he did not wish it to be known. As she had already, however,
mentioned the circumstance to Louisa, the request came too late,
and Mr. Holmes, as above-mentioned, had now become aware of
the villainy of his son-in-law. His resolve to question Emma on
the subject, after her arrival, was abandoned, on witnessing the joy
which she displayed on again meeting with her parents and sisters.
The family all agreed that it would be cruelty to broach the matter
at present, and that it had better be deferred to some more fitting
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Orme had been at home a month, and was preparing to
return to Redhill, when her father took an opportunity of asking
her who it was she saw at the bank, how often she had been there,
what sums of money she had received, and what circumstances
induced her to go. To all these questions she replied in very direct
terms, and when she had finished, expressed her gratitude to her
father for his kindness, and hoped that now he would consent to be
reconciled to her husband.</p>

<p>"Your husband, my child, has been pursuing one uniform plan
of deception, from the time he first saw you to the present hour;
and though this last instance of his duplicity is not the most fatal
to your happiness, it is certainly the most hazardous for his own.
I gave him no drafts, nor have I seen him since your marriage."</p>

<p>"Not seen him, father!"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor given him any checks!"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"How in the world did he get them then?"</p>

<p>"He has forged my name, Emma, and made you the innocent
agent in his villainy."</p>

<p>"And is it possible! Am I the wife of such a man!"</p>

<p>"Such a man is your husband; and if the law now take its course,
he will be liable to transportation for life."</p>

<p>"O! father, spare Charles. Have mercy on your poor Emma;
though he were the most wicked man alive, he is still my husband."</p>

<p>"I shall refrain from prosecuting him; but it will be necessary
to put a stop to such a system of fraud."</p>

<p>"O! my father, what will now become of me and my babe!"</p>

<p>"You have left your home once, my child, without my consent,
but I hope you will not leave it again."</p>

<p>"Never, father! if you will permit me to remain, though I fear
my presence will be a source of perpetual anxiety."</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes, after deliberating on the matter, sent the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
letter to Captain Orme, unsealed, in an envelope, addressed to the
Colonel:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have seen the forged checks which you got cashed at
my banker's; and on inquiry find that you induced my daughter to
present them, by telling her that I had given them to you, as a
token of my reconciliation. I presume you are aware of the consequences
to which you have subjected yourself; though you may
suppose that a regard for my daughter's feelings, and the reputation
of her child, will induce me to forego a prosecution. I have, however,
to warn you against the repetition of such a base and hazardous
course, for there are bounds which the tenderest humanity will not
suffer to be passed with impunity. I should hope, for the honour
of your father's character, that he was ignorant of the crime which
you have committed; but I fear you are not the only person that
is involved in the guilt of its commission."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this letter he received the following reply the next day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You say you have detected my fraud, and express your
fear that I am not the only person that is involved in the guilt of it.
Very true, Sir. Your own daughter suggested to me this mode of
getting at some portion of her fortune&mdash;procured the blank checks&mdash;and
went herself and got them cashed; and now you are at liberty
to let the law take its course, if you please. She is unfortunately
my wife; and as she is once more under your roof, I hope she will
remain there till I send for her, which will not be till you are induced
to give her a fortune equal to my rank, as I was fully entitled
to expect on marrying her. My father, who feels too indignant at
your base insinuation to reply to it, begs me to say, that he does not
choose to admit your daughter into his house again. You will, therefore,
permit me to return your own compliment, by saying, that all
intimacy between our families has ceased, and you may be assured,
that I regret that any intimacy was ever formed.&mdash;Your obedient
servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Charles Orme</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter confirmed the suspicions which had been, for a long
time, excited in the breast of Mrs. Charles Orme; and though the
open avowal of her husband's baseness produced a painful impression,
yet it decided the course which necessity compelled her to
adopt; and she could not forbear sending him the subjoined
letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Husband</span>,&mdash;I cannot, in justice to myself, remain silent, after
reading your letter to my father&mdash;a letter which is a very natural
sequel to your perfidious conduct. That you should feel at liberty
to charge upon me the baseness of suggesting the crime of which
you have been guilty, is more than I could have imagined; but it
has relieved me from that bitter regret which I should otherwise
feel in being separated from you for life. You have betrayed me&mdash;you
have reproached me&mdash;you have insulted me&mdash;but this, it appears,
is not enough: you now try to disgrace me. Have you lost
all sense of honour? Does no feeling of generous sensibility move
in your breast? Are you become an alien from every virtuous principle?
and do you wish, if possible, to sink me into contempt, after
having abandoned me and your child? I feel too indignant to throw
back the reproaches which you have cast on me. I have a home, and
a peaceful one, and you may rely upon it, that no false professions
of attachment shall ever again induce me to leave it. I am unable
to judge of your state of mind; but if you have the slightest degree
of remorse left, conscience must reproach you bitterly.&mdash;Your much
injured</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Emma</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I shall now anticipate my narrative a little, and conclude the history
of Captain Orme. Soon after sending the preceding letter to
Mr. Holmes, he obtained a military appointment in the East Indies,
through the influence of Lord &mdash;&mdash;; and immediately embarked,
without making any communication to his wife, or expressing any
wish to see his infant child. She knew not the place of his destination
for nearly two years after he had left his native country, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
she received a letter from him. On opening the letter she very
naturally expected to find some relentings for his past unkindness,
and some promises of future amendment, but she was disappointed.
The influence of time, which generally softens down the asperities
of temper, and brings about a cordial reconciliation between the
most hostile parties, had only increased the malevolence of his disposition;
and as though he had not already inflicted a wound sufficiently
deep, he now proceeded to the most heartless and unmanly
abuse. He accused her of infidelity; reproached her for her attachment
to her own family, whom he reviled in the lowest terms; and
concluded by saying, that she might now put on her weeds, as it
was not his intention of ever returning to claim her as his wife, or
even to acknowledge as his son the child she had borne.</p>

<p>As she still cherished an attachment for him, notwithstanding
his cruel treatment, and had indulged the forlorn hope of seeing
him reclaimed from the paths of evil, the contents of this letter
produced at first a deep melancholy; but as she had now begun
to derive consolation from a source of happiness which is concealed
from the eye of the gay and the dissipated, she soon regained her
composure, though she ceased not to pray for her erring husband.
At length the report of his death reached her through the medium
of a friend. She wept when she heard of his decease, and expressed
a strong anxiety to know the cause of it. Many inquiries
were made, but no information could be obtained, till she received
a letter from a military officer who had known him in the East.
This gentleman spoke in high terms of his courage, and of the important
services which he had rendered to the government of
India; expressing, at the same time, his regret that he fell a victim,
not to the sword, but to his habits of intemperance, which became
so inveterate, that neither reason nor authority could subdue them.
Thus terminated a union planned by treachery, which a perverse
will led Emma Holmes to contract, but which she lived to regret
with bitter and unavailing sorrow.</p>

<p>Her husband's cruelty, in first abandoning his wife and child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
without bidding them adieu, and then insulting her by his base
accusations, was not more flagrant and unjust than his perfidy in
first inducing her to become his wife. Though pity could not
withhold the sympathy which her sufferings excited, yet every impartial
spectator was compelled to acknowledge that she had
brought them on herself by her own imprudence. And though
such instances of cruelty and treachery are frequently occurring
in the history of human life, and though they are held up by the
moralist as beacons to warn the incautious female of the danger to
which she is exposed, yet how often, alas! do we see such warnings
disregarded. Women are too often smitten by external appearances,
and too easily imposed upon by the artful tales of the perfidious
and the crafty, to listen to the advice of their best friends.
Thus braving the opposition of their parents, they plunge themselves
into a state of misery, without having, as a melancholy
alleviation to their anguish, the solitary consolation that they were
not apprized of their danger. I have seen, in my passage through
life, many fine characters wrecked on this fatal rock, and wish
to guard the thoughtless and inexperienced from a similar catastrophe,
and though I cannot suppose that I shall be able to change
the purpose, when it is once formed, yet I do not despair of exciting
some degree of precaution in the unfettered and uncorrupted
mind.</p>

<p>As that union, which is ordained to be the source of the purest
felicity, or of the bitterest anguish, and which nothing but death
or guilt can dissolve, is the most important that can be formed,
no one ought to propose it, or consent to it, till after the most
mature deliberation. In some instances it has been known that
<em>short</em> courtships have led to happy marriages; but the instances
are comparatively few. Two persons accidentally meet&mdash;strangers
to each other&mdash;an offer of marriage is made, and immediately accepted;
a few weeks of intercourse, or of correspondence elapse,
and they are united for life. Can such a hasty union, which has
taken place while the parties have been almost entirely ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
of each other, be expected to yield much domestic felicity? It
may, but the chances are against it; as the history of social life
demonstrates this fact, that domestic happiness is less dependent
on the agreeableness of each other's persons, than on the harmony
of each other's disposition; and though a magic charm often renders
us blind to the defects of the beloved object, this blissful dream is
soon dissipated when the wedded pair come to seek their happiness
in the amiability of each other's tempers, and the goodness of each
other's principles. And considering the immense importance of
this correspondence in mental taste, tendencies, and inclinations, as
a source of permanent domestic happiness, and the amazing diversity
of tempers and dispositions which is known to prevail amongst
human beings, will a wise man, or will a prudent female, venture
to risk their felicity for life by a sudden and precipitate union?
What! shall we deem it necessary to institute a severe inquiry respecting
the temper, and disposition, and principles of the servants
we take into our dwellings, and whom we may dismiss at our pleasure;
and think that no such inquiry is necessary in relation to
the person to whom we are to be united for life&mdash;who is to be our
comfort or our torment, the means of elevating us to honour or
sinking us into contempt! Would this be an act of wisdom or of
discretion?</p>

<p>And is it not to be regretted that the period of courtship, which
is intended to give to the parties an opportunity of judging of their
fitness for each other, is usually the period in which the greatest
degree of duplicity prevails? It may be justly denominated the
intermediate state between the two conditions in human life, over
which the evil spirit of deception presides&mdash;investing the character
with imaginary charms&mdash;softening down rugged and uncouth
tempers into the smoothness of the most subduing tenderness&mdash;curbing
restless and ungovernable passions with the restraints of a
crafty policy&mdash;and giving such a fascination to external graces, that
they are received as substitutes for the most solid and substantial
virtues. This is the fatal period, when suspicion is usually asleep;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
when a slowness of heart to believe the rumours of report becomes
proverbial; and it is not till the parties emerge from this delusion,
to the realities of married life, and resume their real character, that
they discover the deception they have been practising on each
other. Then the work of mutual recrimination and reproach commences.
Then it is their eyes are opened to see their folly and
their danger, but their repentance, like that of Esau's, comes too
late to repair the evil which they have brought upon themselves.</p>

<p>As the period of courtship is the most dangerous in the history
of life, because the most deceptive, those who wish to enjoy a state
of permanent domestic happiness, cannot, at this period, be too observant
of each other's tempers and dispositions, or too inquisitive
respecting each other's connections and manners. If they now discover
a dissonance in any of these particulars, they would act a
wiser part to separate by mutual consent, than to form a union
which will inevitably become a fruitful source of misery, and may
terminate in disgrace, if not in ruin. Some severe moralists contend,
that when an offer of marriage has been given and accepted,
no circumstances will justify either party in withdrawing from their
pledge, but that it ought to be held as sacred and as obligatory as
the marriage vow. Though the writer would not hazard an opinion
which would tend to sanction a wanton inconstancy, yet he claims
the privilege of differing from such casuists. For what purpose has
the unanimous consent of mankind required some period of time to
elapse, after the offer has been made, before it is formally, and for
life decided? Is it not that the contracting parties may have an
opportunity of judging of their relative fitness for each other? If
not, they may pass at once to the nuptial altar, after mutually consenting
to their union; but if it be, they are invested with a moral
right to revise their decision, when fresh discoveries of character
are made, which change their opinions, and diminish, if not alienate
their affections. Suppose a gentleman makes a lady an offer, and
she accepts it, under a firm conviction that he is a man of honour,
of integrity, of virtue, and of prudence, whose disposition is amiable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
whose circumstances are respectable, and who is capable of maintaining
her in the rank in which she has been accustomed to move.
Suppose that on a subsequent inquiry, she finds out that these sterling
qualities do not adorn his character&mdash;that he is violent in his
passions&mdash;and that his means to support a family are not adequate
to its demands. If she is now convinced that by consummating the
union, her happiness for life will be sacrificed, ought she to be compelled
to do so? She may be censured for giving her consent too
hastily; but is a consent given under false impressions, and while
in a state of total or partial ignorance, to be binding, when she
discovers the delusion which has been practised on her, and sees
nothing but misery and wretchedness before her? I think it is not.
If Emma Holmes, when she returned the letters and presents to
Captain Orme, had never more consented to see him, would any
wise or prudent person have passed a sentence of condemnation on
her conduct? No! Why not? Because she had given her consent
under false impressions of his character; but after her marriage,
though that took place under the same false impressions, she was
bound by the laws of God and man to remain his wife.</p>

<p>But as there is always some risk of reputation, and sometimes
some pecuniary risk, in breaking off an engagement which has been
formed, it should not be done hastily, nor for trifling reasons.
Though the mutual pledge is less binding than the nuptial vow,
yet if it be treated with levity and contempt, society will resent the
insult which is offered to its sense of delicacy and of honour. The
faithless and inconstant will be marked out as the objects of its
censure and reproaches. And no censures can be too severe, nor
any reproaches be too bitter, to be directed against the man who
gains the affections of a female, and then abandons her from caprice;
or against that female, who acts the part of a coquette, by giving
pledges she never intends to redeem, and exciting expectations she
has resolved to disappoint. And this risk ought to operate as a
powerful motive to induce the utmost degree of caution when making
or when accepting an offer. As the right of overture is claimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and exercised by man, he is supposed to institute every necessary
inquiry before he makes his election, and to be perfectly satisfied
that the female whose friendship and whose affection he courts is
capable of promoting his happiness; and though on a closer intimacy
he may discover some shades of imperfection which were not visible
when he first knew her, yet if they are only the ordinary imperfections
which belong to the human character, he would act an unwise,
if not a criminal part, by making them the ostensible cause of breaking
off the connection. We should ever remember, that the nuptial
vow always unites two imperfect beings, whose mutual imperfections
will call for the exercise of mutual candour; and when pure
and ardent love glows in the breast of each, they will bear with each
other's failings, and strive to promote each other's happiness.</p>

<p>It is then, in the opinion of the writer, only when some radical
defect is discovered in the character&mdash;some strong repulsive quality,
or some untoward and ungovernable passion&mdash;that the male sex,
who exercise the prerogative of choice, ought to feel at liberty to
disengage themselves, unless the female give her unqualified approbation.
In that case the connection may be dissolved at any time,
as it cannot be supposed that a marriage between two persons who
are willing to separate for life can be productive of happiness.</p>

<p>But without acting capriciously, or presuming to encroach on the
principle of equity, I should be disposed to concede to the female
sex a greater degree of liberty on this point. When an offer is made
to a lady, she may feel no reluctance to it&mdash;the person who makes it
may be agreeable to her, and, by the ardour of solicitation, she may
be induced to yield assent to the proposed union. She may do this
before her modesty allows her to make those inquiries respecting
temper, disposition, principles, and resources, which the gentleman
is supposed to have made before he ventured to disclose his wishes.
She may have been pressed to a compliance before she acquired that
specific information which would justify and sanction it; and which,
if advantage had not been taken of her amiable weakness, she would
have withheld till she had obtained it. And perhaps, in addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
this, she has been induced to conceal the overture from her parents,
or her guardians, till some convenient season should arrive to make
it known&mdash;that convenient season being to be determined, less by
the decision of her own mind, than the mind of her lover. When
these circumstances occur in the history of a courtship, though I
would not say that the lady is quite as free to reject the offer, as
she was when it was first made, yet I think she is more at liberty
to decline it, than the gentleman who made it. Yet she ought not
to act capriciously, nor ought she to sport with the feelings of the
person to whom she has given her promise; but slighter reasons for
breaking off the connection will justify her in doing so, than those
which will justify him. She may discover no radical defect in his
character, yet she may perceive "the flaw unseemly"&mdash;she may behold
no predominating principle of evil, yet she may see its corrupting
influence&mdash;she may feel no strong repulsive qualities, yet
her affections may die off, while she knows not the cause&mdash;she may
witness no sallies of an ungovernable passion, yet she may strongly
suspect the amiability of his temper&mdash;she may not be able to find
out any fixed habits of inconsistency, or positive vice, and yet she
may be convinced that her happiness would be sacrificed for life if
she consented to the proposed union.</p>

<p>A question now arises in which both parties are deeply interested.
Ought a female to marry when she feels conscious that she cannot
be happy with the person who wishes her to become his wife? or
would it be an act of wisdom, or prudence, or of piety, in a man to
drag a victim to the altar, who feels an abhorrence, not to the ceremony,
but to its appalling consequences? No. As mutual love is
the only substantial basis of the union, where that does not exist,
the union ought not to be consummated; and though some evils
generally result from a dissolution of the mutual pledge, yet they are
fewer and less awful and destructive than those which follow a marriage
without affection&mdash;or when the affection of one has to struggle
against the cool indifference or positive dislike of the other.</p>

<p>And if circumstances should render it imperatively necessary that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
either party should break off the connection, this should be done in
the most delicate and honourable manner. The reasons in most
cases should be expressly and unequivocally stated; all vacillation
should be conscientiously avoided; no words of reproach or invective
should be uttered; and for their mutual credit they should speak of
each other among their friends in terms of respect.</p>

<p>But let no female expect that a libertine in principle, or a rake
in practice, will ever make a kind and attentive husband, notwithstanding
any professions he may make. Her charms may for a
season operate as a spell on his passions, and he may, under their
powerful influence, appear "a new creature." The company of the
dissolute may be forsaken for the pleasure of her society; and the
habits of vice may be broken off while he is courting the living
image of virtue; but his character will remain the same. He may
affect to deplore his past follies, and he may speak in praise of goodness
and of religion, but, unless his <em>heart</em> is changed, he will soon
give ocular proof that he is the same man as when he made an open
mock of sin, and publicly contemned righteousness. That some who
have been dissolute in their early days have become the ornaments
of society, good husbands, kind parents, and faithful friends, is a fact
too generally known to be doubted; but their reformation has
usually preceded their marriage&mdash;rarely followed it. They have
separated themselves from evil-doers, and they have learned to do
well, before they have dared to solicit the affections of a virtuous
female; and then having re-established their character, and fixed
their habits of goodness and of religion, they have lived to repair
the injury they have done to their own reputation and to the morals
of others, by walking in a course of exemplary consistency.</p>

<p>But there are no females who ought to be so cautious on this subject
as the children of pious parents. If they have imbibed the
spirit of pure and undefiled religion, they ought to marry <em>only in the
Lord</em>. No intellectual talents, no degrees of moral excellence, and
no resources of wealth, should induce them to a violation of this
positive injunction of the law of God. It would be, in addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
an insult offered to Divine authority, a suicidal act in regard to personal
honour and happiness; uniform experience proving that the
intermarrying of the pious with the unconverted is followed by the
most disastrous social and spiritual consequences.</p>

<p>And if they are not decidedly pious, yet if they have been accustomed
to habits of religion, they ought not to calculate on permanent
happiness if they consent to marry a person who is an avowed
infidel, or one who cannot distinguish between the form of godliness
and its power. For such a marriage will separate the woman from all
intimate connection with her pious friends, and she will thus become
to them a source of deep and poignant sorrow. But this, though an
evil which a daughter ought to guard against, out of respect to the
feelings of her parents, is a minor evil, when compared with the influence
it will have over her own mind. The irreligion of her husband
will tolerate none of the customs with which she has been so
long familiar&mdash;no family prayer&mdash;no reading of the Scripture&mdash;no
reverential references to God&mdash;to Providence, or to an eternal world&mdash;the
Sabbath will be employed as a day of business, or of indolence,
or of pleasure&mdash;or if the husband attend a place of worship, he will
go, not</p>

father with the irreligion of her husband?&mdash;the devotional lessons of

of childhood, and yield herself to the beguiling fascinations of gaiety
and worldliness, what will be her reflections and feelings in the hours
of sickness, and from whence can she derive consolation and hope
when death approaches? Ah, it is <em>then</em> the secrets of her soul will
speak out! it is <em>then</em> that her criminal folly will appear in all its
aggravated forms of guilt! it is <em>then</em> she will revert to her former
home, her earlier associations, her pristine impressions of religious
truth. Alas! she now goes back to these scenes, not for comfort,
but for torture; not to gather up the fragments of hope, but to
give a keener point to her desponding fears; to call back "joys that
are departed," and to increase the intensity of her mental anguish,
by contrasting it with the happiness she once enjoyed. Yet, if she
discloses what she feels, she is either ridiculed for her superstitious
folly, or suspected of partial derangement&mdash;as no one understands
her case. She lingers through the last stages of her life in sorrow
and in sadness, the victim of self-consuming anxieties and grief; and
may die in agonizing apprehension, if not in absolute despair.</p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE CHAPEL.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_413.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The painful and prolonged excitement occasioned by
Emma's unhappy marriage, and its disastrous consequences,
so greatly impaired the health of Mrs. and
Miss Holmes, that a change of air and scene was deemed
absolutely necessary. Dawlish, their favourite retreat, was thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
of, and they were making preparations for their departure thither,
when a letter arrived from Mr. Newell, Mr. Holmes' son-in-law, in
Warwickshire,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> announcing that the new chapel which Mr. Holmes
had been the means of rearing near his native place, was all but
completed, and inviting them to spend some time with him, and be
present on the opening day. This induced them to change their
mind. "I certainly," said Mr. Holmes, "ought to go, to witness
the accomplishment of my design." "And we," said his wife and
daughter, "should very much like to accompany you; we may thus
reap a spiritual benefit while endeavouring to recruit our bodily
health."</p>
</div>

<p>The village of Lynnbridge, Warwickshire, near which Mr. Newell
resided, was delightfully situated on the slope of a hill, commanding
an extensive and beautiful prospect. At the foot winded the
Lynn, much renowned as an excellent trouting stream, and here
crossed by a handsome stone bridge, over which lay the highroad
to London. A narrow lane, richly adorned in summer with dog-roses
and other wild flowers, led to the village above, which was
rather of a straggling description, without any principal street.
The houses were for the most part of a humble order, few rising to
the dignity of two stories, but all displaying that air of neatness
and comfort which so distinguishes our English villages above those
of any other country. Each had a flower garden in front, very
prettily kept; and the cottages, which were generally white-washed
and thatched, had their walls often adorned with vines, ivy, or
honey-suckle. At the extremity of the village, looking down upon
the river, stood the parish church, a venerable Gothic edifice, with
its churchyard, encircled by a row of ancient yew trees. Adjoining
the church was the rectory, a picturesque and comfortable-looking
old English mansion, with its pointed gables, well cultivated garden,
and rather extensive pleasure grounds. Shady lanes led in all
directions to the surrounding country; the prospect of which, as
already mentioned, was of the most charming nature, comprehending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
an endless variety of hill and dale, wood and corn-fields, and reminding
the gazer unconsciously of Cowper's lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis pleasant, through the loopholes of retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To peep at such a world."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The population was for the most part agricultural, but there were
some gentlemen's seats in the neighbourhood, besides a few farm-houses,
and several villas with a few acres of ground attached to
each.</p>

<p>Whether humanity is more depraved in a city than in a village,
still remains an open question; but I have uniformly found that in
both, the old and the young evince the same predilection for what
is evil, and the same antipathies to what is pure; and if left without
any enlightening and regenerating process, will bear a striking
resemblance to each other in the great outlines of their moral
character. Observation proves, I think, that the city, by its more
varied attractions, facilitates the broader and more marked development
of the essential depravity of our common nature. Yet in the
inhabitants of a village we not unfrequently discover appalling ignorance,
with its consequent vices of impiety, profanity, and intemperance,
associated with extreme vulgarity of manners; an abject
submissiveness to their superiors, and an extreme rudeness in their
intercourse with each other.</p>

<p>In regard to moral and social features, Lynnbridge was a very fair
specimen of an English village, neither better nor worse than the
average number; it had its church and its rector, its wardens to
attend to ecclesiastical matters, and its overseer to look after the
poor. There was no school, however, for the training of the young
in the way in which they should go; nor had the pure gospel of
the grace of God ever been preached to the people. In the neighbourhood
of this village, Mr. Newell had taken a farm, and been
settled there a few years before the date of the occurrences which I
intend to narrate.</p>

<p>The farm rented by Mr. Holmes' father, and on which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
been born and brought up, was situated a few miles from Lynnbridge,
and from old associations he naturally took an interest in
the village. On one of his visits to his son-in-law, he was much
shocked with the appearance which it presented on a Sabbath evening.
The large green on the banks of the river was crowded by
the youth of both sexes, devoting the sacred hours of the day of
rest to various popular sports, while their seniors filled the public-houses.
Loud bursts of laughter were heard from all quarters, and
he learned that brawls and boxing matches were by no means of
rare occurrence. It was while contemplating this scene of disorder
that Mr. Holmes formed the praiseworthy resolution of having a
chapel built, and supporting the minister till the people were able
and felt disposed to do so themselves. As soon as he made known
his determination, his son-in-law, and several other gentlemen, voluntarily
offered to co-operate with him. One gave a piece of land,
another supplied part of the timber, and others subscribed their
money; and though some ridiculed the design, and a few interdicted
their tenants and their labourers from assisting in its accomplishment,
yet, like the Hebrew temple, the chapel gradually rose, in spite
of all opposition, till at length it was finally completed.</p>

<p>Having heard that the Rector of the parish was much displeased
with this projected encroachment on his ecclesiastical province,
Mr. Holmes called on him, to explain the reason and motives of his
conduct, and though he failed in obtaining his concurrence, yet he
was assured that he would offer no opposition, as he held sacred the
principle of unrestricted religious liberty. He returned from this
interview more gratified than he expected he should be, having
found the old Rector an amiable and intelligent man, far advanced
beyond many of his order in the catholic liberality of his opinions
and principles.</p>

<p>The chapel was finished within the space of six months; and when
every preparation was made for opening it, Mr. Newell, as already
mentioned, sent notice to Mr. Holmes, who accordingly set out for
Warwickshire, accompanied by his wife and eldest daughter. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
arriving at Lynnbridge they found Mr. Newell waiting with his
chaise to take them to Thornwood, about two miles distant, where
they were received with the greatest joy by Mrs. Newell, the second
daughter of the Holmes family, whom neither her mother nor sister
had seen for a considerable time. After the first greetings were over,
the conversation, as might be expected, turned on the late unhappy
occurrences in the family, in connection with Emma's marriage.
Then the subject of the new chapel, which was to be opened on the
ensuing Sabbath, was introduced by Mr. Newell, who informed his
father-in-law that the opposition raised against the measure had
gradually died away, and some of the most violent and bigoted of
its opponents had been brought to admit, that it was likely to prove
advantageous to the morals of the people. After some discussion
of this topic, which served to divert their attention from more
painful matters, Mr. Newell assembled his household for evening
worship, and shortly afterwards the family retired to rest.</p>

<p>The following days were employed by the ladies in visiting the
dairy, the garden, the poultry-yard, and examining other objects of
rural interest; and by Mr. Holmes and his son-in-law in rambling
over the farm, and discussing the various agricultural operations
then in progress. At length the Sabbath morning dawned on which
the chapel was to be dedicated to God. Mr. Holmes rose at an
early hour, but was rather disappointed to find the sky looking dark
and lowering; on going, however, into the fold-yard, he met the old
shepherd, who, on being asked his opinion of the weather, quietly
surveyed the sky, and said, "I think, Sir, the dark clouds will blow
off, and we shall have a fine day." This remark quite raised his
spirits, as the shepherd was considered a sort of weather prophet,
and this time at all events his words proved true, for as the morning
advanced the clouds began to disperse, the bees were seen passing
and repassing the parlour window; and just after the family
had finished breakfast, the sun burst from the dark mantle in
which he had been enveloped, and diffused his bright and enlivening
rays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a pleasant thing," said Mr. Holmes, "to see the sun; but I
have never gazed on it with more delight than at this moment."</p>

<p>"A fine emblem," Miss Holmes replied, "of Him, who sometimes
in an unexpected moment breaks in upon the midnight of the soul;
and who, I trust, will arise and shine on the inhabitants of this
benighted village, and bless them with the light of life and immortality."</p>

<p>The chapel, a neat plain structure, was erected on a piece of freehold
land, near the bank of the river, where the villagers had been
accustomed to spend the sacred hours of the Sabbath in riotous
amusement. It was crowded to excess, many persons having come
from a great distance to be present at the opening. The Rev. Mr.
Broadley of B&mdash;&mdash; commenced the service by reading a hymn, which
was sung with great animation and delight. This was followed by
reading the Scriptures, and prayer; and then the Rev. Mr. Wyatt,
who had arrived for the occasion from London, preached a very
beautiful and impressive sermon from John iii. 16&mdash;"For God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>

<p>"I am not aware," he remarked, after he had repeated his text,
"that I could have selected a more important, or a more interesting
passage than that which I have just read. So powerfully does it exhibit
the love of God towards fallen man, that though I could speak
with an eloquence equal to that of an angel, I should be incapable of
doing it adequate justice. God so loved the world, that he gave his
only begotten Son; and yet, by many, this gift is esteemed as a thing
of nought; and all references which are made to its immense value,
are regarded as the sallies or excesses of a disordered imagination,
or a mean and contemptible fanaticism. He has 'so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life.' But alas! the danger
which awaits us is disbelieved; and the happiness the Son of God
came to bestow is despised."</p>

<p>Mr. Wyatt divided his text in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>I. The moral condition of men, of every rank, and of every description
of character, is alarming.</p>

<p>II. To deliver them from this state of moral danger was the
express design of our Lord's mission.</p>

<p>III. Such is the tenderness of his compassion, that whosoever
believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

<p>IV. Saving us from the misery which we deserve, by the gift
of his only begotten Son, is a most astonishing display of the love
of God.</p>

<p>When speaking under the second division of his sermon, on the
design of our Lord's mission, he delivered the following passage,
which made a deep impression on the audience:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had one of the highest orders of angels assumed a human form,
and announced to us some scheme of redemption from evil and from
ruin, it would have been on our part an act of folly and ingratitude
to have treated the message of mercy with indifference. But,
brethren, no angel, however exalted, could redeem man from the
curse of a violated law, or conduct him to the repossession of that
purity and honour, from which, by transgression, he has fallen.
Therefore God gave his only begotten Son, who united in his own
person every attribute of Deity, and every perfection of humanity;
displaying a majesty, combined with a tenderness of character, which
alternately excite our awe and confidence. With what ease did he
rule the elements of nature&mdash;heal the maladies and disorders produced
by sin&mdash;recal the souls of the departed from the invisible
world; while, with all the familiarity and compassion of a near and
beloved friend, he mingles his tears of sympathy with the suffering
mourner, and diffuses the peace of heaven over the heart oppressed
with sorrow.</p>

<p>"Suppose, my brethren, one of the elders of Israel, after having
been present at the giving of the law at Sinai, and after having seen
and heard the mysterious sights and sounds on that mount of awful
majesty and terror, had then fallen into a trance, and continued in
that state till the night before the vision of the shepherds on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
plains of Bethlehem. Suppose he had then awoke and been told,
that the law, which had been given with so many awful accompaniments,
had been broken, and that the Lawgiver was on the eve of
sending his only begotten Son into the world&mdash;would he not have
concluded that his mission must be one of vengeance? But no!
'God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that
the world through him might be saved.' He gave his only begotten
Son that we might not perish, but have everlasting life. What is
it for man to perish? I cannot tell&mdash;I have never seen the judgment-seat
of Christ!&mdash;I have never beheld the awful glory of that
scene of terror!&mdash;I have never heard the final sentence, Depart!&mdash;I
have never been banished far and for ever away from bliss!&mdash;I have
not endured the agonies of the worm that never dies!&mdash;the fire that is
never quenched! Indeed, my brethren, I cannot tell what it is to
perish! It is a state of misery which no imagery can represent&mdash;which
no language can describe&mdash;which no imagination can conceive.&mdash;'But
have everlasting life!' It is life which gives to every other
possession its determinate value. For what is beauty without
life but a fading ornament? what is wealth without life but a
useless substance? what is honour without life but a bursting
bubble? Skin for skin, all that a man hath will he give for his
life. So much do we prize this invaluable possession, that rather
than lose it, we will consent to part with one limb, and one sense
after another, till all are gone. But, brethren, the period is not far
distant, when, like our forefathers, we must resign it, and be numbered
with the dead; yet Jesus Christ says, that he that believeth in
him shall never die. This promise must be taken in a restricted
sense, as his disciples are no less liable to the visitations of death
than his enemies. Their faith in him does not operate as a charm
to repeal the law of mortality; neither does it exempt them from the
diseases and pains which usually precede its infliction. But though
they die a natural death, yet they immediately enter on the full
enjoyment of eternal life&mdash;when they dissolve their connection with
the inhabitants of this world, they become fellow-citizens with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
saints in light&mdash;when they close their eyes on this earthly scene,
they open them on the visions of celestial glory&mdash;and when their
bodies are committed to the tomb, their immortal spirits are enjoying
that endless life, over which death has no power. This life will
be a life of perfect purity&mdash;of perfect knowledge&mdash;and of perfect
felicity; and will continue unimpaired by sickness, and undisturbed
by care, for ever and for ever.</p>

<p>"And our text says, that <em>whosoever</em> believeth in the Son of God
shall have everlasting life. No one is denied the invaluable blessing
on account of the obscurity of his origin, or the inferiority of his rank;
for though these circumstances of distinction have a powerful effect
on us, yet they have no influence over the mind of the Saviour, who
looks with as much benign regard on a penitent villager as a repenting
citizen; and is no less willing to save a poor neglected pauper
than the rich nobleman who fares sumptuously every day. Whosoever
believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting
life. The most debased, impure, and worthless, if they truly lay
hold of the Saviour, come within the circle of this comprehensive
promise, and have the same warrant to expect forgiveness and final
salvation, as the apostles of Jesus Christ had. 'And the Spirit
and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.
And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him
take the water of life freely' (Rev. xxii. 17)."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A short time after the Village Chapel had been set apart for the
worship of God, and the Rev. Mr. Swinson, its minister, had commenced
the discharge of his regular services, a spirit of opposition
arose from a very unexpected quarter. Some of the more respectable
farmers, and two magistrates, waited on the clergyman of the parish,
to express their astonishment that he should give his sanction to a
measure, which, in their opinion, was calculated to endanger the
Church.</p>

<p>"Indeed, gentlemen," said the Rector, the Rev. Mr. Trevor, "I have
not sanctioned it. When Mr. Holmes called on me to explain his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
motives for building the chapel, he said his object was to reform the
village. I expressed a wish that he might succeed in that particular,
but at the same time told him that I did not think he would."</p>

<p>"Reform the village, Sir!" said one of the magistrates, "the village
wants no reformation. The people are honest, industrious, virtuous,
and happy; and what reformation do they require?"</p>

<p>"But they are rather remiss in their attendance at church; and
they have frequently pastimes on the green on a Sunday evening,
which I think ought not to be tolerated."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Sir, they do not attend the church quite so often
as they ought to do; but as for the pastimes on the green, I rather
think you must have received some exaggerated report of them, for
I candidly confess that I never saw anything to disapprove of."</p>

<p>"I have heard of their dancing on a Sunday evening," replied the
Rector, "and of many of them getting intoxicated, which you must
allow, gentlemen, are not very reputable engagements for a Sunday
evening."</p>

<p>"They are a cheerful, merry set of folks, Sir; and some of them
may sometimes take a little more ale than is good for them; but I
never saw anything in their amusements to disapprove of. Indeed,
I think the scene which the green presents on a Sunday evening is
one of the most picturesque which a country life can exhibit; displaying,
as it does, such varied lights and shades of rustic character.
The young and old intermingle together; and those who are too
infirm to engage in the innocent frolics of their youthful days, look
on, while others react the parts they once performed. The utmost
degree of hilarity prevails amongst them; and in these relaxations
they forget the toils and cares of the week."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," replied Mr. Trevor, "I certainly think that
the poor, no less than the rich, ought to be left to choose their own
pleasures, without being controlled by others; and if any of them
prefer worshipping their Maker on a Sunday evening, to joining in a
public gambol, they ought to be permitted to do it. I cannot consent
to impose any restraint on the consciences of others, as I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
not like to submit to any restraint myself. Indeed, opposition on
our part would be both impolitic and unjust; the spirit of an Englishman
rises up in defiance against any interference with his religious
opinions, and his opposition becomes more decided and more
zealous in proportion to the efforts employed to restrain his liberty
of conscience."</p>

<p>Though these persons could not induce their amiable and intelligent
Rector to unite with them in their attempt to put down what
they termed <em>the new religion</em>, yet they resolved to employ all the
influence they possessed to accomplish their purpose. How to do
it in the most effectual way, and yet not involve themselves in any
hazardous responsibility, was a question which perplexed them.
After various discussions they resolved to prohibit all their tenants
and servants from attending the chapel&mdash;to withhold parish pay
from those paupers who went&mdash;and to refuse associating with the
more independent and respectable parishioners who gave it the
sanction of their presence. Having agreed on their plan of operation,
they proceeded to act on it with vigour, and the effects were
immediately felt; for on the following Sabbath the congregation
assembling at the new chapel was reduced to less than one-half of
its usual number. This determined opposition was rather discouraging;
but as yet Mr. Swinson and those who adhered to him were
permitted to remain unmolested. But a storm was gathering; and
the evil spirits who had set themselves against the introduction of
evangelical religion into the village, resolved to make one desperate
effort to expel it. Some of the baser sort were selected as the
agents of the plot; and everything being arranged, they came in a
body on a Sunday evening, and while Mr. Swinson was preaching,
they entered the chapel, and by their noise and tumultuous behaviour,
compelled him to desist and the people to retire. As he was
quitting this scene of confusion, he was grossly insulted, some of the
rioters brandishing their sticks over his head, and threatening that
if he dared enter the chapel again, he should not be permitted to
escape with his life.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="swinson" id="swinson"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MR. SWINSON ASSAULTED BY THE MOB.</p>

<p>Vol. ii. p. 396.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>The report of these proceedings soon spread through the neighbouring
country; and while some raised the "loud laugh," and defended
the conduct of the assailants, others came forward to aid in
resisting the tyranny which was attempting to trample on the rights
and liberties of the people. It was well known that the actors on
this occasion were instigated secretly by parties behind the scenes&mdash;that
they were the mere agents of "the respectable and intelligent
few," who had resolved on the extermination of this so-called new
religion; and though Christian sympathy wept over their ignorance,
and mercy pleaded for their forgiveness, yet it was felt by Mr.
Holmes and his friends, as a duty they owed to the reputation of
the clergyman who had been insulted, and to the liberties of the
people which had been trampled on, to bring the perpetrators of
this disturbance to punishment. Warrants were immediately
granted by a neighbouring magistrate for the apprehension of all
the culprits, and they were bound over to appear at the next sessions,
there to be tried for disturbing Mr. Swinson and his congregation,
while engaged in public worship, and for threatening the life
of the minister, if he attempted to continue the discharge of his
pastoral duties.</p>

<p>No sooner had these thoughtless and misguided young men returned
from the presence of the magistrate, than they began to
regret the part they had acted; and frankly confessed, that they
should never have engaged in the affair, had it not been for Mr.
Wingate, an extensive proprietor in the neighbourhood, and his
friends. "They put us up to it," one of them said, "and promised
that no harm should come to us if we would kick up a <em>row</em>."</p>

<p>There is no class of men in society who occupy a more respectable
or a more enviable station than our country gentlemen. But living
on their own patrimonial estates, in the midst of a thinly scattered
population, consisting for the most part of poor and ignorant peasantry,
they frequently display more of the domineering spirit of
feudal times than any other class of men in the kingdom: and
though they have made some progress in intellectual cultivation, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
accordance with the spirit of the age, yet they still lag far behind
the great body of their countrymen in liberality of sentiment and
benevolence of disposition. They are too apt to regard the peasantry
with supercilious contempt, and endeavour to keep down,
by oppression, the rising spirit of freedom. They too often seem to
consider those who have no riches, as beings having no rights&mdash;whose
quiet complaint is to be considered as provocation, and
whose mildest remonstrance is to be regarded as insolence. They
have been in past times most active in opposing the introduction of
the gospel of Jesus Christ into the villages over which they exercise
an authority; and many of the popular outrages which have been
committed against the ministers of the gospel, have originated in
their suggestions or direct efforts. But now a change has come
over the land for the better. This may be partly attributed to that
spirit of independent inquiry which is spreading amongst our peasantry,
who seem disposed to withstand all encroachments on their
freedom of choice and action; and while they are not wanting in
civility and proper subjection to their employers, bow not, as their
forefathers did, to the yoke of arbitrary oppression.</p>

<p>When the sessions came on, the friends of the accused made every
possible effort to defeat the ends of justice, but they were foiled in
the attempt. The case was stated in a clear and forcible manner&mdash;the
evidence which supported it was full and conclusive&mdash;and
though their acquittal would have given many of the spectators of
their trial a triumph, yet an honest jury returned the verdict which
the injured laws of the country demanded, and the rioters were found
guilty. As they made, however, a handsome apology, and entered
into a recognizance to keep the peace, and to come up for judgment
when called on to do so, Mr. Holmes and his friends consented to
stay any further proceedings, and this gave general satisfaction.</p>

<p>After this decision, the spirit of persecution declined, and the
peasantry, finding that they were protected by the laws of the
country, resolutely determined to enjoy the freedom which no man
could take from them. They now pressed in greater numbers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
hear the preacher, who had given such decisive proofs that he knew
how to practise the forbearance which he enforced, and exercise the
mercy which it was his duty and his delight to proclaim. When
preaching one Sabbath evening, shortly after the trial, from 1 Tim. i.
13&mdash;"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
but I have obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief"&mdash;he
saw two of the ring-leaders of the late riot sitting in a back seat
in the gallery of the chapel. Without appearing to notice them, he
took occasion, from the subject he was discussing, to make a strong
appeal to their consciences. After delineating the character of
Paul, as a blasphemer and a persecutor, and as one who had injured
the reputation and destroyed the peace of others, he passed by a
natural transition to his present audience, and thus addressed
them:&mdash;"Happy would it have been for the world, if the spirit of
persecution had died out of it when Saul of Tarsus was converted
to the faith of Christ; but alas! my brethren, it survived that
memorable event, and has continued in existence to the present
day. In former times it dragged the disciples of the Redeemer to
prison, confiscated their property, and then consigned them to the
flames; and though its power is now restrained by the laws of our
country, yet it still retains all its native rancour and malignity.
It would now react the part by which it formerly disgraced our
national history, and plunge us into all the horrors and sufferings
which our ancestors endured; but thanks to a kind and merciful
Providence, we are guarded from its violence by the majesty of the
British law, and are permitted to assemble together, where and
when we please, without dreading opposition or disturbance from
any one.</p>

<p>"Our duty in relation to our persecutors is to pity them, for they
do it ignorantly in unbelief, and to pray that they may obtain
mercy. And have we not encouragement to do this, seeing that God
is sometimes pleased to transform the persecutor into a preacher
of the gospel? Hence the apostle, when writing to the church at
Galatia, says: 'But they had heard only, that he which persecuted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.'
What a change! What a miracle of grace! What a proof that
Christ Jesus came to save the chief of sinners! And am I now
addressing any one who has attempted to disturb us in the enjoyment
of our religious privileges, or who has been in the habit of
reviling or threatening us? You see how we are protected, and
though we have not chosen to enforce the full penalties of the law,
yet a repetition of the offence will render such forbearance in future
absolutely impossible. But I flatter myself, that those who have
opposed us, will do so no more; and that even the persecutors
themselves may be induced to implore mercy. Yes, O persecutor,
He against whom thou hast raised the rebellious hand, waits to be
gracious&mdash;<em>he</em>, whose authority thou hast trampled on, and whose
grace thou hast despised, is now looking down with an eye of compassion,
more willing to pardon and to save, than to punish and
destroy. If you continue in a state of rebellious impenitence, you
will treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath; but
if you now repent and pray, and believe in him, you will be forgiven,
and finally admitted into his presence in heaven, where you
will enjoy a state of purity and happiness for ever. Let me then
urge you to return home, and on your knees pour forth the prayer
of the publican, 'God be merciful to me a sinner;' and should it
please God, who 'delighteth in mercy,' to answer this prayer, you
will then feel a stronger attachment than you ever felt aversion to
the gospel of Christ."</p>

<p>It often happens that the cause of the Redeemer is promoted by
the very means employed to crush it; and of the truth of this remark
the above narrative furnishes a striking instance. Mr. Swinson's
congregation at Lynnbridge increased so rapidly, that <em>it</em> became
necessary to erect a large front gallery in the chapel; and
many of the inhabitants of remoter parishes, being induced to come
and hear the man who had been so unjustly treated, solicited him
to visit them and preach during the evenings of the week. "So
mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed" (Acts xix. 20).</p>

<h2>VILLAGE CHARACTERS.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_430.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">A few weeks after the termination of the struggle, so
successfully maintained by the managers of the village
chapel, against the encroachments of bigotry and intolerance,
I received a letter from Mr. Newell informing
me that Mr. and Mrs. Holmes had quitted Thornwood to return to
the Elms, but had left Miss Holmes to remain a little longer with
him and Mrs. Newell. He proceeded to say, that as his friends who
had filled his house were now departed, he should be very happy if
I would pay him a visit, and that if I could arrange to remain for
a little time, I might then accompany Louisa on her return to the
Elms, and thus fulfil the promise which I had formerly made to
Mr. Holmes. This invitation came very opportunely, as I had just
been labouring under a slight indisposition, for which change of air
was strongly recommended. I had a great desire, too, to see again
both Mr. Newell and Miss Holmes; and, accordingly, after arranging
matters for an absence of a short period, I took my seat in the
coach to Lynnbridge, where Mr. Newell was waiting to receive me
with his chaise. Till then I had never before been in that part of
the country, and was quite delighted with the beautiful drive from
Lynnbridge to Thornwood. On arriving there I had the pleasure
of meeting again Miss Holmes and Mrs. Newell, neither of whom I
had seen since the marriage of the latter a few years before in London.
I need not here enlarge on the kind reception which I received
from all, or recount the details of the pleasant and cheerful
conversation in which we spent the evening.</p>
</div>

<p>The following day, after an early dinner, Miss Holmes, Mrs. Newell,
and myself (Mr. Newell having some business to attend to) sallied
out for a walk. "Louisa shall be our cicerone," said Mrs. Newell;
"I think she knows more of the country hereabouts than I, who
have lived in it for several years." "Perhaps, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," she continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
addressing me, "you would like to see some of our <span class="smcap">Village
Characters</span>. They are to be found everywhere; but I think this
place has rather more than its share of them. Louisa, I believe,
knows them all already, as she is a most ardent student of the different
phases of humanity." I, of course, expressed my readiness to
accompany the ladies wherever they chose to lead me; and we, accordingly,
bent our footsteps towards a homestead about a mile off,
occupied by Mr. William Harris, one of the finest specimens of the
old English farmer I had seen for a long time. He was a stout-built
man, rather inclined to corpulency, with a fresh ruddy face and a
sharp keen eye; but the best description I can give of him is that
furnished me by Miss Holmes, as we walked towards his house.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harris," she said, "is, as might be expected, blunt in his
manners, but frank and obliging in his disposition, of an hospitable
and genial nature, and as regular as clock-work in all his domestic
arrangements. He lives in the house in which his grandfather was
born, and which is shaded by a large oak tree, that has outlived
many generations, and is likely to outlive many more. He rises in
the summer about five, breakfasts at half-past six, takes his dinner
exactly as the clock strikes twelve, smokes his pipe in the porch between
six and seven, then takes his supper, and retires at nine, to
sleep away the long and tedious hours of night. He is, upon the
whole, a very worthy man, though rather pedantic in his way. He
received what he calls an <em>edecation</em>, when young; his father having
sent him for six months to a boarding-school about twelve miles off;
besides giving the old parish clerk two guineas to teach him the rules
of addition and multiplication. He farms a small property of his
own, on which his modest mansion stands, and rents another farm
about double the size, under Lord &mdash;&mdash;; and is regarded by most of
his fraternity rather clever in his profession. He is a good judge
of live stock; is celebrated for the excellence of his butter and cheese;
decidedly attached to his Church and his Queen; generally consulted
on all parish questions; and universally admitted to be one of the
best weather-tellers in the neighbourhood, though the shepherd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
says he has known him out in his reckonings. He has served the
office of overseer eleven times, which forms one of his chief tales in
all companies; has been churchwarden six times; was, when a young
man, regularly enrolled amongst the yeomanry of the country at the
time of the threatened invasion in the year 1804, and often expresses
his regret that no opportunity ever occurred to enable him to distinguish
himself in the annals of war. He goes to church with his
comely dame every Sunday; repeats the responses in an audible
voice; reclines his head on the top of his staff, while <em>appearing</em> to
listen to the sermon; reads one chapter in the Old Testament and
one in the New every Sunday afternoon; and then indulges himself
with an extra glass and pipe with a few friends, either at his own
house, or at the inn on the green. But he is, to quote his own language,
a <em>mortal enemy</em> to the Methodists; and will not suffer any of
his servants, if he knows it, to attend the chapel. He says that the
old religion is the best; and he thinks that no one ought to be suffered
to change it. He often says he hopes to live long enough to
see the Toleration Act repealed, which he declares is a disgrace to
parliament."</p>

<p>He happened to be smoking his pipe, with his arms resting on
the little gate in the front of his house, as we were approaching it;
and in exchange for the courteous salutation we gave him, he invited
us to taste his ale, which, he said, was a prime fresh tap. This
offer we declined with thanks, as we preferred a glass of cold water,
which excited his astonishment.</p>

<p>"You like water better than good ale! well, every one to his liking,
I say; but give me a good tankard of prime home-brewed.
You be a stranger, I think, Sir, in these parts," he continued, addressing
me, "I don't remember of ever seeing you here before."</p>

<p>"I have never been in this part of the country before," I replied,
"and have just been admiring the fine scenery which surrounds your
village on all sides. There is a good proportion of hill and dale;
and the parish church on the brow of the hill, looking down to the
river, is a most interesting object."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, it looks very well. There were no trees about it,
except the old yews, till I was appointed churchwarden, fourteen
years ago, last Easter Monday, when I had them planted, and they
have thriv'd very well. I have heard many gentlemen say it is a
great improvement. They say it gives a kind of a finish to our
church. They have often drunk my health for doing it."</p>

<p>"But the inside of the church is not so neat and clean as the outside
is imposing."</p>

<p>"No, Sir, it's sadly neglected now; but when I was warden, it
was the cleanest church in our parts."</p>

<p>"How often have you duty performed in it?"</p>

<p>"Once every Sunday, when I and my dame go as regularly as the
doors are opened; except when it's very wet, and then I go alone.
She has a touch of the rheumatics in bad weather; worse luck: and
gets deafish if she goes."</p>

<p>"As it is so small, I suppose it is crowded on the Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, not much of that; for the people go to the chapel
that's built yonder on the green. People now-a-days an't satisfied
with the good old religion of the Church; they must have this new
religion that's springing up all over the country."</p>

<p>"Do you know what this new religion is?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir. I'm satisfied with the religion my fathers had before
me, and so I don't trouble my head about it; but I understand it
makes people very miserable. Now, my religion never made me
miserable, and I don't think it ever will. I am for letting well
alone."</p>

<p>"I suppose you wish to go to heaven when you die?"</p>

<p>"Aye, to be sure, I do. I shouldn't like to go to t'other place.
They are badish off there, so the parsons tell us; and I suppose they
know all about it, as they studied at the univarsaty."</p>

<p>"But we ought not to expect to get to a place unless we go the
right way."</p>

<p>"That's true, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought much about the difficulty of getting into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the right way which leads to heaven? I suppose you have read
what Jesus Christ says on this point? 'Enter ye in at the strait
gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,
and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is
the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few
there be that find it' (Matt. vii. 13, 14)."</p>

<p>"Aye, I recollect reading them <em>varses</em> t'other Sunday, and I felt
a bit puzzled to make out their meaning."</p>

<p>"But, Farmer, they have a meaning, and a very important meaning."</p>

<p>"So I guess, or Jesus Christ wouldn't had them put into the Bible.
Can you tell me the meaning, as I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Why, the meaning is just this: the many get into the broad way,
that is, the wrong way, and they are lost, and perish in hell. Have
you not read the verses which almost immediately follow?&mdash;'Many
will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name
done many wonderful works? and then will I profess unto them, I
never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity' (Matt. vii.
22, 23)."</p>

<p>"Now, Sir, allow me to ask you one question. If we go to church,
and pay every one his own, and are as good as we can be, do you
not think that we shall go to heaven when we die? We can't be
better than that, you know, Sir; and there are not many in these
parts so good as that."</p>

<p>"As you have asked me a question, will you allow me to ask you
one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir; twenty, if you please."</p>

<p>"Are you as good as you can be?"</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, Sir, I might be a bit better; but you know we
are all sinners: the more's the pity."</p>

<p>"Then, how can you expect to go to heaven on your own principle
of reasoning? Now, Farmer, let me tell you, that you are under a
delusion which will prove fatal unless you are undeceived. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
read the New Testament with attention, you will perceive, that two
things are necessary to fit us for heaven: the first is, we must be
born again; and the second is, we must repent of, and forsake all our
sins, and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"Repentance: aye, that's very proper when people do wrong; but
I have never done anything I am ashamed of. Why, Sir, I have
been overseer eleven times; and there's ne'er a pauper in the parish
but will say that I always acted with the greatest charity. I go to
church&mdash;read my Bible&mdash;and pay everybody his own; and I don't
think God requires anything more than this; and I suppose you
will think this is very fair as times go?"</p>

<p>"But are you born again?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what that means; it puzzles my brains; but then
I'm no scolard; though I know a good bit about farming, like."</p>

<p>"Then if you do not know what it is to be born again, that's a
proof that you are not born again, for if you were, you would understand
what it is."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I should. Then according to your talk, though
I go to church, I am not likely after all to go to heaven. If you are
right, I am on the wrong tack; but what must I do to get right?
'Tis time I looked about me, for I shall be sixty-eight next Lady-day,
and that's a great age; though my father lived till he was fourscore,
and my grandfather was ninety-one when he died; and I had
an uncle who lived to see a hundred and three. You see we are a
longish-lived set&mdash;about the oldest livers in these parts."</p>

<p>"I think you can't do a better thing than overcome your prejudices,
and go and hear the preaching at the village chapel, where
these things will be explained to you; and it is very likely that
there you will gain in a few months more information on religious
subjects than you have acquired in all your life."</p>

<p>At the mention of the chapel he shrugged up his shoulders and
said, "Why, if I was to go there I should have half the parish
laughing at me. I shouldn't be able to show my face at market.
My old friends would give me the cold shoulder. No, no, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
never do for an old warden, who has been in office so often, to leave
church and our old Rector, for a Methody chapel and a Methody
parson."</p>

<p>"One word, Farmer, and I will soon finish. Are you such a
coward as to care for what others say, when you are doing a thing
for your own advantage? Will you suffer the laugh of the ungodly
to deter you from getting into the <em>narrow</em> way that leads to heaven;
and consent to be lost with the many, rather than saved with the few?"</p>

<p>"These sartanly are plain questions, and I'll give them a turn over
in my mind. I must confess that your talk has satisfied me&mdash;that
I know but little&mdash;the more's the pity&mdash;about the good things of the
Bible; and I think as how I shall take your advice, and go and hear
the gentleman who preaches in the chapel. If I don't like what he
says, I need not go again, and it is but right to give him a hearing
before one condemns him."</p>

<p>"Very true."</p>

<p>We now wished Mr. Harris good day, and proceeded on our
walk. A short distance onward we passed a neat cottage by the
roadside, in the little garden in front of which we saw a lady walking
up and down at a solemn pace. As Mrs. Newell was acquainted
with her she stopped to ask her how she did. As she did not perceive
us before Mrs. Newell spoke, being wrapped up in her own
airy musings, she seemed startled, as though some spectre had
suddenly made its appearance, but recovering her composure, she
politely invited us to enter her modest habitation.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Madam," said Mrs. Newell, in her usual kind manner,
"to see you so indisposed."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Miss Newnham, "I am very ill&mdash;very ill indeed.
I was never worse in all my life. I have not had a wink of sleep
these two nights. I sent for the doctor yesterday, but he did not
come till this morning; and he says that I am not ill. But I feel
that I am very ill indeed. Dr. Bland does not understand my case.
I shall send for Dr. Gordon, who is more clever in his profession;
so my aunt tells me, and so my old servant says."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you been ill long, Madam?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"O no, Sir! I was very well this day fortnight. I spent the
evening at Mrs. Paul's with a party, and stayed rather later than
usual; and on coming home, just as I was passing along the churchyard,
I saw a very bright star shoot down from the sky."</p>

<p>"It did not, I suppose, fall on you?"</p>

<p>"O no! it didn't fall on me; but, Sir, I had such a dream! and
I awoke about three o'clock in the morning in such a terror, that
I have not been well since. And every night, but two, since then,
the screech owl has perched itself on the ledge of my window, and
kept up its hideous noises so long, that I have been obliged to have
my servant sleep in the same room with me ever since, and that's a
very unpleasant thing: particularly so."</p>

<p>"And if, Madam, it be not an impertinent question, may I be
permitted to inquire into the nature of your dream?"</p>

<p>"O Sir! I dreamed I went to Weston to purchase a new dress;
and the shopman, by mistake, took down some crape instead of
printed muslin; and just at that time in came Mr. Noades, the
undertaker, and said he wanted some stuff for a shroud, for a lady
who had died suddenly. And I awoke in such a fright! Indeed,
I have not been myself since. My nerves are so shook. My very
shadow makes me tremble. I am afraid I'm going to die."</p>

<p>"Well, Madam, it is certain you will die, and you may die suddenly;
but do you think that this dream will hasten the time of
your death?"</p>

<p>"But, Sir, when I awoke I heard the death-watch as plainly as
you now hear me speak."</p>

<p>"And do you suppose, Madam, that the Supreme Being has communicated
to this insect a knowledge of your approaching death,
and sent it, in the stillness of the night, to give you warning?"</p>

<p>"But, Sir, I heard the death-watch several times when my sister
was ill of a decline, and she died about six months afterwards. I
said she would die. I was quite sure she would."</p>

<p>"Very likely; and though you may trace a connection between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
her disorder and her death, yet what connection can you trace between
the noise of this little insect and her death?"</p>

<p>"But, Sir, since the screech owl left my window, our dog has done
nothing but howl for the last two nights. O! it is so dismal to lie
awake and hear it. It makes me tremble like an aspen leaf."</p>

<p>"And do you think that the howling of the dog is a prognostic
of your death, any more than the death of either of your servants?"</p>

<p>"I remember, Sir, the dog howled most awfully just before my
grandmother died: and when she heard it she said she should be
sure to die, and she did die sure enough."</p>

<p>"And how old, Madam, was your grandmother when she died?"</p>

<p>"Ninety-two, all but four weeks and three days."</p>

<p>"And she really did hear the dog howl some short time before her
death?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, about five nights before she died; and all the servants
heard it; and they were so frightened; and they all said, nothing
can save her after these howlings."</p>

<p>"Very likely; and as most dogs occasionally howl in the night, it
would be very strange if some person did not die after such howlings;
but can we suppose that the Supreme Being employs shooting
stars, insects, owls, and dogs, to announce to us the approach of our
death?"</p>

<p>"And don't you believe, Sir, in such omens? Everybody does in
our parish."</p>

<p>"I believe that ignorance and superstition have invested these
sights and sounds with an ominous import, and that many allow
themselves to be terrified by them; but what can be a stronger
proof of the absurdity of such a habit, than the fact that the star
often falls, the death-watch often ticks, and the dog often howls,
when the patient recovers, and lives for years to relate the terror
and alarm which these scare-crows of superstition had excited in his
breast."</p>

<p>"I hope, Sir, I may live, and if I do, I shall then have a proof
that there is nothing in it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>"And pray, Madam, have you never known a patient recover from
his illness even after he has been warned of his approaching death
by these omens of terror?"</p>

<p>"O yes, Sir, my dear mother was once very ill, and for seven
nights our dog howled as he did last night; but she lived seven
years afterwards, and when she died no noises were heard."</p>

<p>"Now, dear Madam, excuse me, a stranger, taking the liberty of
talking so to you; after what you have just mentioned, what stronger
proof do you require of the folly of being alarmed by sounds which
the inferior tribes of nature utter, and which you must know, on
reflection, are no sure indications of any future event in the history
of human life? That you will die is certain; and that you will enter
the eternal world is certain; and that you will stand before the
judgment-seat of Christ is certain; and that you are ignorant of
the exact time when these great events will take place is equally
certain; but instead of allowing your mind to be agitated by these
senseless sounds, you ought to be preparing for the final issue of
life."</p>

<p>Here our conversation ended, and we then took our leave, Miss
Newnham thanking me for the interest I had taken in her welfare,
and hoping that I would call again on her before I left Thornwood.</p>

<p>Addison has a good paper on the propensity which weak and superstitious
people indulge, to give an ominous meaning to many of the
casualties of life; and to allow themselves to be more terrified by the
screeching of an owl, the clicking of an insect, or the howling of a dog,
than the real and afflictive dispensations of Providence. As society
improves in knowledge, especially the knowledge of the Scriptures,
this propensity will become weaker and weaker; and though some
traces of its existence may be discovered, at times, in the most cultivated
minds, yet it is not invested with that magic power which it
exercises over the illiterate. Many efforts have been employed to
expose its absurdity, but if we intermingle with the uninformed inhabitants
of a village, we shall have indubitable evidence that its
influence still continues to operate. The same elegant writer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
whom I have just referred, observes:&mdash;"I know but one way of fortifying
my soul against these gloomy presages and terrors of mind,
and that is, by securing to myself the friendship and affection of that
Being who disposes of events, and governs futurity. He sees, at one
view, the whole thread of my existence, not only that part of it
which I have already passed through, but that which runs forward
into all the depths of eternity. When I lay me down to sleep, I recommend
myself to his care; when I awake, I give myself up to his
direction. Amidst all the evils that threaten me, I will look up to
him for help, and question not but he will either avert them, or turn
them to my advantage. Though I know neither the time nor the
manner of the death I am to die, I am not at all solicitous about it;
because I am sure he knows them both, and that he will not fail to
comfort and support me under them."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>
<p>Shortly after leaving Miss Newnham, we turned aside into a fine
old park; and feeling rather fatigued, seated ourselves beneath a
clump of trees that stood near the foot-path. As we sat watching
the hares and rabbits which came out of a neighbouring coppice, and
the stately deer which fed around us, unawed by our presence, the
Squire passed by, and in a most good-humoured and kindly manner
invited us to take some refreshment at the Hall. The invitation was
accepted; and we soon found ourselves in a large antique parlour, in
which the spirit of hospitality had dwelt from time immemorial.</p>

<p>The Squire, or to call him by his own name, Mr. Bradley, was a
fine looking old gentleman, of about sixty years of age, but with a
deep trace of melancholy imprinted on his countenance. He had
one child, who was sent, when eleven years of age, to a first-rate
classical school, to be prepared for Oxford. When about the age of
fourteen, according to a barbarous custom which still prevails in
most of our great schools, he was chosen by a senior scholar to fight
another boy about his own age. After contending till his strength
was nearly exhausted, he received a blow on his right temple, which
sent him lifeless to the ground. At first the boys thought him only
stunned, and taking him up carefully, they carried him into a shed,
when, to their horror, they found that he was dead! Horror-struck
at this ghastly spectacle, they knew not what to do; but at length
the dismal news reached the ears of the master&mdash;medical assistance
was sent for, but it came too late. This fatal catastrophe happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
just before Christmas, when the fond parents were preparing to receive
their child once more under their roof during the holidays.
When the tidings reached them, they were frantic with grief, and
resolved to punish the authors of their calamity; but on cool reflection
they forbore doing so, and sunk down into a state of melancholy,
from which they have never perfectly recovered.</p>

<p>This sad bereavement brought about a singular change in the
habits of the Squire, who now became a very religious man. He had
family prayer morning and evening, attended church regularly, and
observed the fasts with a degree of monkish austerity which is rarely
met with amongst Protestants. As his religion, however, contained
no recognition of a living Saviour, it did not reach his heart, nor
produce that exquisite taste for the enjoyment of spiritual things
which is formed when the inner man is renewed in its spirit and
disposition.</p>

<p>And here the author would remark, before he gives the sequel of
this interview with the Squire, that the Christian scheme of salvation
differs from every other system of religion in one very important
particular&mdash;it does not admit any person to the denomination of
a believer, who does not feel its influence on his heart; nor can a
person discern its adaptation to the moral condition of man, till such
influence is felt. Hence it discriminates between the man who holds
the truth in unrighteousness, and the man who receives it with meekness
and in faith; and while it imparts to the latter all its consolations
and its hopes, it pronounces the sentence of condemnation on
the former, although his moral character may be adorned with the
varied beauties of social virtue. To the one it unveils a scene of
contemplation, which displays the purity and grandeur of the Divine
nature&mdash;the equity and glory of his wise, yet mysterious dispensations
of providence and of grace; to the other it remains as an unconnected
and unharmonious scheme of religion, which no skill can
simplify, and which no labour can methodically arrange. To the
one it opens a fountain of living waters, of which they who drink
never thirst after a more salubrious draught of happiness; to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
other it is as a stagnant lake, whose waters are bitter, like those of
ancient Marah. To the one it makes known a Saviour, in the efficacy
of his death, in the riches of his grace, and in the prevalence of his
intercession: to the other it exhibits him as the Man of sorrows, who
once fasted in the desert, and preached in the temple&mdash;who once
wept on Olivet, and groaned on Calvary&mdash;and who derives all his
celebrity from the records of history, rather than from the manifestation
of his love in renewing and sanctifying the soul. So that
while these two persons profess the same faith, bear the same denominational
character, worship in the same church, and observe the
same ceremonial rites and institutions; they cannot hold any communion
with each other in spirit, because their perceptions, taste,
and moral inclinations are as much opposed to each other as the
purity of the Divine nature is opposed to the impurity of the
human.</p>

<p>"It is now," said the Squire, "fifteen years since I lost my son.
It was a grievous affliction&mdash;one which has embittered life to me:
and if I could overcome the dread of death, I should long to lie
down in our family vault, to rest in peace with the dead of past
generations."</p>

<p>"To lose a child," I replied, "in the common course of nature,
must be a severe affliction to a parent; but to lose an only son, and
in such a way as you lost yours, must be a trial almost too heavy to
be borne."</p>

<p>"O, Sir, it nearly bereft us of our senses; and we have gone but
little into company since. There's his likeness," pointing to a good
painting hanging over the fireplace, "and it is a very correct one; and
here is his favourite dog, which we have preserved; but you see,
like his master, his life is gone. This is the end of man."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, it is appointed unto man once to die, and after death
the judgment."</p>

<p>"And it is this judgment after death which makes death so dreadful.
I have been preparing myself for my latter end ever since the
death of my child; and the more I think of its solemnity and importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
the more I am alarmed. We know what this life is; but
of the next life we have no knowledge; and we know the beings
with whom we now associate; but who can form a conception of
disembodied spirits?"</p>

<p>"The dread of death often operates as a spell on the happiness
of life; and brings down the wealthy and prosperous to a state of
mental wretchedness, equally deplorable with that of the destitute
and forlorn."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the Squire, with great emphasis, fixing his eye on myself
as he spoke, "it brings us lower, because, as we have stronger
temptations to the love of life, we have greater reluctance to resign
it. Here we are distinguished by greater possessions, occupy a more
exalted station, and have a greater variety of enjoyments at our
command; but we are not sure that we shall be even admitted into
the kingdom of heaven when we die; and, for aught we know, the
same fate may await us which befel a certain rich man, of whom we
read in the Bible."</p>

<p>"That fact, Sir," I replied, "is calculated to excite a high degree
of terror in the breast of a rich man, because it teaches us, that God
does not continue the line of distinction between the rich and the
poor beyond this life."</p>

<p>"The distinction, Sir, may be preserved, but it may be against
us, as poor Lazarus was comforted, while the rich man was tormented.
I have a servant, who works for me in my garden, on
whom I often look with envy; and if I could attain that composure
in prospect of death which he possesses, I would gladly exchange my
mansion for his cottage."</p>

<p>"I presume, Sir, he is a religious man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a religious man, and so am I; but he has the art
of deriving consolation from his religion, while I can derive none
from mine."</p>

<p>"But how is that? Is he a more learned or a more virtuous
man than you are?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir; he is virtuous, and he is intelligent for a person in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
rank of life; but he says he does not derive any consolation from
his virtue."</p>

<p>"I presume, Sir, he is a man of prayer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and so am I, though I use a form, and he prays extempore&mdash;so
I have heard."</p>

<p>"I presume he attends a place of worship?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he now goes to the chapel which has lately been built in
the village. This is the only thing in his conduct I disapprove of.
I think we ought to keep to the Church, and not sanction this new
religion, which is overrunning the country."</p>

<p>"But now, suppose this new religion, as you term it, should be the
very religion from which your gardener derives all his consolation
against the fear of death, would it not be an act of cruelty and of
injustice if you were to attempt to deprive him of it?"</p>

<p>"But why can't he derive his consolations from the religion of the
Church of England?"</p>

<p>"Then, Sir," I replied, "why don't you? You say that you have
attended your parish church regularly for the last fifteen years, and
yet you are as much in dread of death as you were when you first
entered within its doors."</p>

<p>"Very true; there's a mystery about it which I can't unravel."</p>

<p>"Shall I explain it, Sir?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would; and as it is a question which perplexes
Mrs. Bradley no less than myself, I will fetch her, if you will excuse
me for a few minutes."</p>

<p>The Squire soon returned, accompanied by his lady, who welcomed
us to the Hall, with the greatest cordiality and politeness.</p>

<p>"Now, Sir," said the Squire, "if you will explain to us how it is
our gardener derives that consolation against the fear of death from
this new religion, which we cannot derive from the good old religion
of our forefathers, you will confer a great favour, and we shall
esteem your visit the most agreeable one we have ever received."</p>

<p>"In the first place," I observed, "you have fallen into a mistake.
The religion of the chapel is not a new religion, but the religion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
the Bible, exhibited in a simple and popular form, and does not
differ from the doctrinal articles of the Established church."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir. Why, then, my gardener and I profess the same
faith. But how is it he derives so much consolation from that
which gives me none?"</p>

<p>"Because, to quote the language of the Scripture, he has been
renewed in the spirit of his mind, and has had the eyes of his understanding
enlightened, so that he is enabled to trace the connection
between the facts of Christianity and their application to his mind;
while you, for want of this supernatural illumination, admit the
facts only, without perceiving how they can, or how they do, produce
the intended effect. For example: you admit that you are a guilty
sinner in relation to God, and under a sentence of condemnation,
which is the reason why you dread death; and you admit that Jesus
Christ died for sinners; but you cannot perceive <em>how</em> it is that
his death operates to remove guilt, and to inspire a hope of eternal
blessedness. There is, if I may use such an expression, a palpable
darkness intervening between the fact of human guilt, and the fact
of the Saviour's death for its expiation, which prevents your seeing
how the latter does actually become the means of removing the
former. Hence your faith in the death of Christ does not give you
that consolation of which you sometimes hear your pious gardener
speak; because, for want of an adequate power of perception, you
cannot see how to apply its moral efficacy to your heart and conscience."</p>

<p>"How to apply the moral efficacy of the death of Christ to my
heart and conscience! Why, I was not aware that anything more
was necessary, on my part, than simply admitting the fact of his
death."</p>

<p>"Then what meaning can you affix to the language of the apostle&mdash;'God
forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto
the world?' But such is the spiritual darkness that rests on the
human mind, that the moral design of his death cannot be perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
without the illumination of the Holy Spirit. Why, the prayers and
liturgy of your own Church most unequivocally recognize the necessity
of this supernatural illumination."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>"I never felt the necessity of this spiritual illumination to which
you refer, or most likely I should have sought after it."</p>

<p>"I presume you would; but your not feeling the necessity of it
forms no valid objection against the necessity of it. It may be necessary,
and yet you may not perceive it; as the natural man, according
to the testimony of St. Paul&mdash;that is, the man unaided by Divine
assistance&mdash;'receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they
are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they
are spiritually discerned."</p>

<p>"You have certainly opened a new path of inquiry before me;
and though I cannot at present see the need of any supernatural
assistance to enable me to understand what I read in my Bible, yet,
if the necessity of it be clearly stated in Holy Writ, I shall not hesitate
to admit it.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> But, to advert to the religion of this village
chapel, am I to understand that the doctrines of the Church of
England are preached in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>

<p>"Then they have not brought a new religion into the village?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir; they have brought no new religion into the village, but
merely present the old religion of the Bible and of Protestantism in
a new form."</p>

<p>"And yet when they talk on religious subjects, they employ a
very different phraseology of speech from that which we have been
accustomed to use."</p>

<p>"Very likely, because they are more familiar with the phraseology
of the Scriptures than you are; and they feel the power of
religious truth on their heart more forcibly than you profess to do.
Your religion, if I judge from your conversation, is the religion of
opinion, theirs of belief&mdash;yours of speculation, theirs of principle&mdash;yours
of forms and ceremonies, theirs of knowledge and of feeling&mdash;yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
of times and seasons, theirs of habitual devotion; and while
you derive no consolation from the routine of duties which you perform,
they have peace with God through Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said the Squire, "that their religion makes them
happy, and raises them above the fear of dying&mdash;the great points I
have been aiming to reach for fifteen years, but I am as far off as
when I first began the pursuit."</p>

<p>"If, Sir, you had been labouring under some physical malady for
the space of fifteen years, without deriving any benefit from the
prescriptions of your regular family physician, I presume you would
call in other advice?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, Sir; I should suspect his want of judgment."</p>

<p>"Why not, Sir, act on the same principle, on the more important
question relating to your soul&mdash;its peace, and its salvation? Your
attendance at the church has been in vain. Why not dismiss your
prejudices, and go to the village chapel? You have ocular demonstration,
that the people who worship there are happy, and live in
the anticipation of future happiness. Why not make the experiment,
which can subject you to no loss, and may lead to a glorious
issue?"</p>

<p>"We are slaves, Sir, to prejudice. Yes, we create our own tyrant,
and then yield to his iron sway! What fools we all are!"</p>

<p>"I should not object," said Mrs. Bradley, "to go to the village
chapel, if I thought I could obtain any spiritual benefit. I am
weary of life. I want something to bring peace to my heart."</p>

<p>"Make the experiment, Madam."</p>

<p>"I feel inclined to do it; but yet I have a strange reluctance."</p>

<p>"I will venture," said the Squire, "and give a proof that I am
sincere in my efforts to obtain the hope of salvation."</p>

<p>We now left the Hall, much pleased with our visit, and bent our
steps towards home. It was a beautiful evening, and as we passed
along we were charmed by the varied notes of my favourite bird,
the thrush, whose harmony was occasionally disturbed by the cawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
of the rooks on their return from their daily pilgrimage. We
returned to the public road just as the sun was setting, and while
admiring the lustre which he threw around him on his departure,
I remarked to Miss Holmes, what a fine emblem it presented of the
dying Christian, whose pathway through life resembles the shining
light, which shineth brighter and brighter, yet reserves its brightest
splendour for its setting, when a halo of glory encircles him as he
disappears, leaving spectators astonished and delighted more by
the closing scene, than by the progressive majesty of his course.</p>

<p>On ascending the slope leading to the entrance of the village,
a respectable looking man stepped out of a cottage by the roadside,
and on recognizing Mrs. Newell and Miss Holmes, with myself, as
a clergyman, invited us to walk in. His large Bible was on the
table, and the family were preparing for evening worship. After a
little desultory conversation, he begged that I would lead their devotions,
a request with which I gladly complied&mdash;reading a chapter
of the Bible and offering up a prayer.</p>

<p>"I am happy, ladies," said the cottager's wife, when service was
concluded, "to see you in my house; it is an honour which I have
long coveted, but never expected; and we are much obliged to you,
Sir, for your kindness in praying for us this evening. May the
Lord reward you."</p>

<p>"And I am happy," I replied, "that you have an altar of devotion
erected in your family; and I hope that your morning and evening
sacrifices, like those of the Hebrew temple, will regularly ascend
before the Lord of hosts, and be accepted by him."</p>

<p>I was now agreeably surprised to find myself in the cottage, and
in the company of the gardener, whose religion had been the subject
of discussion at the Hall.</p>

<p>"We have just had," I remarked, "a long and interesting conversation
with the Squire on religious subjects; and we were much
pleased with the seriousness of his manner, and the eagerness with
which he listened to our remarks, but like many others, he has no
clear perception of the nature or design of the gospel of Christ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is, Sir," said the gardener, "a most singular man. Sometimes
he is very devout&mdash;reads his Bible with great attention, and
will often come to me in the garden, to talk about religion, and I
have sometimes seen him so powerfully impressed by it, that he has
shed tears when speaking of the restless state of his mind; but at
other times he is equally gay and thoughtless, and disposed to turn
religion and religious people into ridicule. He is very unhappy,
though he is very rich; and has many good qualities, though he is
not a spiritual man."</p>

<p>"I suppose," I said, "you would not exchange your cottage for
his mansion, if you were obliged along with the exchange to part
with your consolations and hopes?"</p>

<p>"O, no, I would not exchange situation and state with my master;
for I am happy, but he is not&mdash;I can think of death with composure,
but he dreads it&mdash;I can look forward to eternity with
delight, but he shrinks back from its approach, as a child would
recoil in terror on seeing some hideous figure."</p>

<p>This pious gardener was the only son of a venerable elder of the
Scotch church, who rented a small farm in the county of Stirling.
He was a most industrious hard-working man; and his wife was a
pattern for economy and frugality. For more than fifty years they
lived together in the enjoyment of domestic happiness; but just
as they reached the evening of life, they experienced a series of
reverses, and poverty advanced upon them as an armed man, compelling
them to give up their farm, to be cultivated by other hands.
Their son took a little cottage for them near the church in which
his venerable father had worshipped God for many years; and
having acquired a scientific knowledge of horticulture, he obtained,
through the medium of a friend, his present situation at the
Squire's; and to his honour he supported his aged parents till it
pleased God to take them to himself. When he came to England,
he was a moral but not a pious man; nor did he feel the influence
of the truth on his heart till after his marriage. His wife was the
daughter of a worthy man, who gave her a superior education; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
to this the God of all grace had added the ornament of a meek
and a devotional spirit. By her chaste conversation, and the influence
of her example, she won over her husband to the reception
of the pure faith of Christ; and though, like most others, they have
had the ebbings and flowings of prosperity and adversity; yet, to
quote their own language, goodness and mercy have followed them
all the days of their life.</p>

<p>Had the gardener's father remained exempt from misfortunes,
his son might have been living in the house in which he was born,
and cultivating the farm his father tilled for fifty years; but then
he had never seen his pious wife, and might still have possessed
only the form of religion. That dispensation which came as the
whirlwind and the storm, to drive him from his home and his
country, led him at length to attain the blessings of contentment
and peace. Thus we often see in the history of life, disastrous
events proving the precursors of personal and domestic happiness,
as the dark and tempestuous morning is not unfrequently followed
by a serene and joyous evening; exciting gratitude and love to the
wise Disposer of all human affairs, in exchange for the perplexity
and sorrow which they may have occasioned.</p>

<h2>THE PIOUS COTTAGER.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_451.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">After staying for about a week under the hospitable
roof of Mr. Newell, I quitted Thornwood, to pay my
long promised visit to the Elms, and was accompanied
thither by Miss Holmes. We had the gratification of
finding all well on our arrival, and I spent with my old friends a
few days very pleasantly; after which it was necessary for me to
return home, though much urged by Mr. and Mrs. Holmes to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
with them for a little time longer. During my stay at the
Elms, I more than once accompanied Louisa to call on Mrs. Kent,
in whom I felt much interested, but who, for some time past, had
been in a very feeble state of health, and was now evidently hastening
to her end. The evening before my departure she rallied a
little, and on the ensuing Sabbath felt herself so strong as to be able
to walk to chapel, at about a quarter of a mile's distance. On Monday,
however, she was again obliged to return to her bed, from
which she never rose. She now gradually sank, and in the course
of ten days peacefully expired. Her history, and some incidents
connected with her death, will be found in the following letter from
Miss Holmes to Mrs. Loader:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">The Elms</span>, <em>17th June, 18&mdash;</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have just sustained a great loss. Poor
Mrs. Kent died yesterday, and I feel that I have indeed lost a friend.
You have often asked me to give you some particulars of her history,
and this I shall now endeavour to do.</p>

<p>"She was left a widow when about the age of forty, with four
children, almost entirely dependent upon her for support. Her
husband, who was a pious man, died of a consumption; the symptoms
of which made their appearance within a few years after their
marriage. But as his outward man decayed, his inner man was
renewed day by day. During his protracted illness, though he had
no raptures when anticipating his death, and the glory to follow,
yet he was favoured with great composure; and when the hour of
his departure came, he died in peace. While he lived, he and
his wife had regularly attended the little Dissenting chapel in the
village, and had always been allowed to do so unmolested, but
shortly after his death the steward of Lord Harwood informed his
widow, that unless she gave up her religious notions, and went to
the parish church, she should not be allowed to remain any longer
in her little cottage. Her reply to this unmanly and anti-Christian
threat, at once displayed the characteristic independence and firmness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
of her mind:&mdash;'As I would not give up my religion to please
his Lordship, you cannot suppose that I will do it to please you, Sir.
You may turn me out of the cottage, but my Father, who knows
that I want a dwelling for myself and children, will provide me
with another, over which you will have no authority.'</p>

<p>"As soon as this threat was known, a very general murmur was
expressed through the hamlet. Many, indeed, thought that it would
not be carried into execution; but a pious gentleman, who felt a
great respect for the memory of her husband, and who knew that
she would always live in terror, while under the power of this petty
tyrant, built a little cottage for her on his own estate, which she
occupied, free of rent, till her death. Three of her children, one
after the other, fell victims to their father's complaint, and were all
buried in the same grave. She was a very industrious, frugal, and
prudent woman; greatly respected by her religious friends, who,
much to their honour, provided an ample maintenance for her,
when she became, through infirmities, unable to support herself.</p>

<p>"Her cottage, which was built on a piece of rising ground, within
sight of the turnpike road, was the neatest in the parish, and bore,
in legible characters, the following inscription:&mdash;'A refuge from
persecution.' This memorial of his cruel spirit mortified the steward,
by exciting public attention; and after smarting under it for
some time, he offered to make any apology to the widow, on condition
that it might be effaced. She became his advocate with her
landlord, and the stone was removed; but ere he had made the application,
Lady Harwood, on riding past in her carriage, having
seen it, was induced to stop, and ask Mrs. Kent why her cottage
bore such a singular inscription. The reason was given, and when
she informed his Lordship, on his return from the Continent, he felt
so indignant, that he sent for his steward, and, after a severe reprimand,
dismissed him from his situation.</p>

<p>"I have spent many pleasant, and I trust profitable hours in Mrs.
Kent's company; and now she is gone, I find the remembrance of
our conversations a source of great consolation. Her knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
the Bible was very accurate and extensive; and the remarks which she
sometimes made on different passages were pertinent and striking.
In her the word of Christ dwelt richly; it composed her perturbed
feelings&mdash;induced a spirit of resignation to the will of God&mdash;opened
before her the prospect of future bliss, and supplied her with subjects
of reflection and conversation, which made her society a source
of much improvement to others. She was well qualified to guide
the young Christian, amidst the perplexities which are apt to entangle
his faith in the early stages of his experience, and guard him
from the fatal evils by which he is often surrounded in his passage
through life. To her conversation my sister Jane is more indebted
than to any other means of religious instruction; and even Emma
would often gladly spend an hour in her society.</p>

<p>"A few months ago her infirmities began to increase upon her;
but we were not alarmed by any symptoms of approaching dissolution,
till about a week before our visit to Lynnbridge. When sitting
with her one fine spring evening, listening to the song of the blackbird
and the thrush, I spoke of the bountiful provision which our
heavenly Father has made for our necessities and gratifications, she
replied in the beautiful language of the poet: 'Yes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">'&mdash;&mdash;not content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every food of life to nourish man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes all nature beauty to his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And music to his ear.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">But this is not the only provision he has made for us. He is now
preparing a place for us, and soon he will come to receive us to
himself.'</p>

<p>"On asking her if she had any fears in anticipation of the end of
her faith, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I have had many, but they are all gone, and though I still have
my spiritual trials, yet I can anticipate the final issue with great
composure. I know in whom I have believed, and am persuaded
that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
against that day.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You long to be gone, I have no doubt?'</p>

<p>"'I certainly long to see <span class="smcap">Him</span>, whom unseen, I have loved for
nearly fifty years, because then I shall be like Him; but I am not
impatient. Indeed, I am not yet prepared to go, for the ties which
bind me to earth are not all broken.'</p>

<p>"'Then this earth still possesses some attractions?'</p>

<p>"'Yes; I have enjoyed, and do enjoy a large proportion of its
comforts; and though I have felt, at times, the storms of adversity,
yet I can say, 'The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I
have a goodly heritage.' Here I am, in my calm retreat&mdash;far away
from the noise of contention and strife&mdash;waiting patiently the great
change; and if the Lord should be pleased to answer my prayers
for the salvation of my dear son, I should then say, 'Lord, now lettest
thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word.'</p>

<p>"'Then you think your son is still living, notwithstanding the
report of his dangerous illness in the hospital at the Cape?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I believe he is. As Abraham saw Isaac in a figure rising
from the dead, so the Lord gave me a somewhat similar vision, the
night after I received my son's letter. I saw him leaving the hospital
well, though leaning on his staff, and pale and wan, as if just
recovered from illness. I have now only one painful trial.'</p>

<p>"Presuming that she referred to the spiritual state of her son, I
remarked, that parents must feel intense agony of mind, in prospect
of having their children separated from them in the eternal
world.</p>

<p>"'I have not that prospect to distress me. I have three already
in heaven, and I doubt not but the grace of God will ultimately
reach the heart of my prodigal son. I cannot doubt it. It would be
a sin to doubt it. I have felt such a spirit of prayer come upon me
at times, on his behalf, that I have wrestled for his conversion, as
Jacob wrestled with the angel at Peniel; and though I have heard
no voice saying to me, 'It shall be unto thee even as thou wilt,' yet
I have departed from the throne of grace in peace, and found my
faith strengthened with power from on high. My faith is so strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
and so uniform in its exercise, that it has cast out fear from my
heart; and I can rejoice in prospect of meeting all my children in
my Father's house.'</p>

<p>"During my absence at Lynnbridge her illness continued to increase,
and Jane used frequently to call on her, and take her some
little comforts which her feeble state required. On my return I
took Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who was paying us a short visit, to see her, and she
seemed to derive great comfort from his conversation and sympathy.
She now gained a little strength, and in a day or two felt herself so
much better as to be able again to go about, and on Sabbath actually
walked to chapel. The exertion, however, had been too much for her,
and on calling at her cottage on the Monday forenoon I was grieved
to learn that she had found herself so weak as to be obliged to return
to bed. I left with her a little wine, which I had brought with
me, and called again to see her in the evening. I perceived that I
must now forego all hopes of her recovery, as her strength was
evidently sinking fast. After some conversation regarding her bodily
ailments, she said to me, 'I have been struggling through deep
waters since your last visit, and even now the swellings of Jordan
are rising higher and higher upon me; and though I have not lost
my anchor, I have been tossed as upon the billows of the great deep.
I trust, indeed, all will be well at last; but I now feel a terror in
prospect of death, which I never felt before. I am now on the verge
of eternity. I shall soon, very soon see God&mdash;the final sentence will
soon be uttered; and if I have been deceiving myself and others,
what will be my doom!'</p>

<p>"'But, my dear Mrs. Kent,' I remarked, 'you should look back
on your past life, and think of the sacrifices which you have made
for the cause of the Redeemer, and the numerous indications of his
approbation which you have received.'</p>

<p>"'I dare not look back,' she replied, with great solemnity, 'unless
it be to increase the intensity of the anguish which at times weighs
down my soul, for I have been an unprofitable servant, and am one
of the greatest of sinners that ever indulged a hope of entering into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
heaven. Look back! no, my dear. I am obliged to 'lift up mine
eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.'</p>

<p>"Two days after this visit I again called, and found her sitting up
in her bed. On extending her hand, she said with great animation,
'The storm is over, and now the sun is shining upon my soul, in his
full noon-tide strength. The bitterness of death is passed; and I
have nothing more to suffer, except a few convulsive struggles,
which nature will feel, when the moment of my departure comes.'
Then raising her hands and her eyes to heaven, she burst forth into
a strain of enraptured devotion. I have preserved a few of her
expressions, which were principally quotations from the Bible, or
Watt's Hymns; but it is not in my power to portray the calm
dignity of her countenance, or the intense fervour of feeling with
which she spoke. 'Blessed Saviour! thou art my Redeemer! Thou
hast borne my sins, and carried my sorrows! Thou hast suffered
the just for the unjust, to bring me to God! Thou art the chief
among ten thousand, and altogether lovely! Thou art the author
and finisher of my faith! To thee do I yield myself, to be redeemed
from all evil&mdash;to be sanctified&mdash;to be presented faultless before thy
Father's glory with exceeding joy! Yes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">'&mdash;&mdash;every smile of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does fresh endearmonts bring;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">and fixing her eyes, as though she saw her Lord, she extended her
arms, and said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Haste, my Beloved, fetch my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Up to thy bless'd abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly, for my spirit longs to see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My Saviour and my God.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I happened just then to turn my head to the window, when I
saw a soldier walking up the pathway in front of her cottage.
Without thinking what I was saying, I exclaimed, 'Here is your
son, Mrs. Kent, come back to you from the Cape!' Never shall I
forget the scene which followed.</p>

<p>"'My son!&mdash;impossible!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>"We heard the latch of the door lifted up, and a deep manly
voice calling 'Mother!' On that word reaching her ear, his mother
sprang up in her bed, and exclaimed, 'It is my son!' but her feelings
were so strongly excited that she had not strength to restrain
them, and before I could return to her assistance, she fell back, and
for some moments we thought her gone. I felt her pulse, but it had
ceased to beat&mdash;her eyes were fixed&mdash;and while engaged with her
faithful nurse in employing the usual means to restore suspended
animation, the door of her chamber was opened, and her son entered
with a smile on his countenance, which was soon exchanged for the
strong expressions of filial grief. He saw what was the matter, and
forbore to speak, but stepping gently to her bedside, he kissed her,
and let fall a tear on her face. 'How long has she been ill?' he inquired;
and just as these words were uttered, we saw a slight motion
of her hand, and soon after she began to breathe softly. On returning
to consciousness, her first impulse was to embrace her long lost
child. No words were uttered by them, but a frequent interchange
of the expressions, 'My child!' 'My mother!' I withdrew to the
window while they remained for many minutes locked in each other's
embrace. I then handed the dying saint a glass of wine, which revived
her; and after reclining on the bosom of her son for some
time, giving vent to her feelings, she became sufficiently composed
to converse with him.</p>

<p>"'O mother, I am sorry to find you in this state; but you will
get well soon, I trust.'</p>

<p>"'Never while I remain in this world, my dear son. But I have
every reason to be thankful. God has always dealt graciously with
me. Even in the midst of the greatest tribulation, He has enabled
me to sing,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Bless'd is the sorrow, kind the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That drives me nearer home.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">But this last expression of his kindness, in permitting me to see you
before I die, is so unexpected, that it is like a miracle wrought in
answer to prayer.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>"'O mother,' the soldier replied, weeping as he spoke, 'your
prayers have been the means of my salvation, and I am thankful
that your life has been spared till I could come and tell you of it.'</p>

<p>"She sat and listened with great interest to his account of his
adventures. While in hospital at the Cape he was visited by a
pious missionary, to whose conversation he ascribed his conversion
to God. 'Before I saw him,' he continued, 'I had many qualms of
conscience; and was often terrified at the thought of death, but
never <em>felt</em> that I needed a Saviour till he spoke to me. His appeals
were like an arrow shot through my soul, and I could get no comfort
till I prayed to Jesus Christ.' He paused to weep, and we wept
with him; when he renewed his narration, and after giving us a detailed
account of his recent preservation during a violent storm on
his return to England, we knelt down, and he commended the soul
of his dying mother into the hands of the Lord Jesus, after which
I took my leave.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kent remained for several days without undergoing any
material change; but on the eighth day after her son's return, he
called at the Elms, and said that his mother was not expected to
live through the day, and wished to see me. I immediately went,
accompanied by my sister Jane. We found her in a most heavenly
frame of mind. After a conversation which lasted about half an
hour, I observed a sudden alteration in her countenance, which convinced
me that the time of her departure was drawing nigh. She
now sat for several minutes in perfect silence; a death-like stillness
pervaded the room, and we all felt an awe on our spirits that seemed
to betoken some great event. She then raised her head, and first
expressed her gratitude to her nurse for her kind attention; thanked
me and Jane for the few favours we had been enabled to show her;
and then taking the hand of her son, she pressed it to her lips, and
said, 'Yes, thou art a faithful God! and as it hath pleased thee to
bring back my long lost child, and adopt him into thy family, I will
say, 'Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation;' then smiling, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
fell back on her pillow, and with one deep sigh her gentle spirit
passed away and left us.</p>

<p>"Thus lived, thus suffered, and thus died, one of the Lord's '<em>hidden
ones</em>,' set apart for himself, to show forth his praise first here on
earth, and now for ever in the celestial world.</p>

<p>"I am happy to say that I can now refer, with some degree of satisfaction,
to dear Emma, in whose welfare I know you take a deep
interest. I speak with caution, yet I think I can say there are some
appearances, which give us reason to hope, that her afflictions are
beginning to yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness. She is now
more frequently alone and with her Bible; still very reserved on the
question of personal piety, but references and allusions accidentally
escape her lips, which induce me to believe that the Lord is gradually
drawing her to himself. Dear creature! she has passed through
a sad ordeal, but I trust she will yet be enabled to say with David,
'It is good for me that I have been afflicted.' Pray for her, my dear
friend, and also for your attached</p>

<h2>THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE YOUNG
CHRISTIAN'S CAREER.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_460.jpg" alt="M" width="100" height="108" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Miss Holmes, as the reader has already been informed,
had suffered much in her health, by the unfortunate
marriage of her sister Emma; but her visit to Lynnbridge
had contributed greatly to her improvement,
and her parents now fondly hoped that she was in a fair way of
recovery. Shortly after the death of Mrs. Kent, however, she experienced
a return of her former alarming symptoms, and an eminent
physician was consulted, whose opinion, though rather reservedly
given, was not of a very hopeful nature. Conscious herself of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
extreme delicacy of her constitution, and apprehensive that she had
not long to live, she now prudently declined an advantageous offer
of marriage which she had received. Her suitor was Mr. Alfred
Reed, the only son of an intimate friend of her father's; a young
man, about her own age, decidedly pious, and who was likely to
come into the possession of a large fortune. He had been bred to
mercantile pursuits, but eventually decided on entering the Church.
His father opposed his inclination, till, being fully convinced that he
was actuated by proper motives, he cordially gave his consent. He
had passed through his examinations at Cambridge with great distinction,
and was now spending the vacation at home, preparatory
to taking orders. His person, his manners, and his profession combined
to render him an acceptable suitor to Miss Holmes, who
united in her character the varied excellencies which are necessary
to qualify a female to fill the important station of a clergyman's wife.
She was intelligent, amiable, discreet, and zealous in the cause of
religion and benevolence, without the smallest tincture of ostentatious
display. Her sense of duty, however, would not permit her,
in her present state of health, to contract a union which might
speedily be dissolved, and involve her husband in much perplexity
and grief.</p>
</div>

<p>By the advice of her medical man, she was induced again to try a
change of air as the best means of arresting the progress of her disorder.
After much deliberation it was decided to go to Dawlish in
Devonshire, both because they had so much enjoyed their former
visits there, and Louisa preferred its retirement to the noise and
gaiety of a more fashionable watering-place. Mr. Reed, who still
continued faithful in his attentions to her, notwithstanding her
refusal of his offer, and still cherished the hope of his proposals being
accepted, on Miss Holmes' restoration to health, was allowed, at his
earnest request, to form one of the party. He accordingly set out
first, to secure a suitable lodging, and it was no small gratification to
the family when they found he had taken the same house which they
had occupied some years before. As they had travelled by easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
stages, and had been favoured with pleasant weather, Miss Holmes
appeared much better on her arrival at Dawlish than when she left
the Elms; and she continued to improve so rapidly, that all began
to anticipate her entire convalescence. Her spirits, which had at
times been deeply depressed, soon rose to the level of her accustomed
cheerfulness; and though the hectic flush occasionally added fresh
beauty to the sweetness of her countenance, yet, as it did not return
so often, nor appear so deeply tinged by the florid hue as formerly,
it did not occasion any alarm. On returning from a lovely walk, as
they passed the little chapel which benevolence raised for the accommodation
of the Christian pilgrim, who thirsts for the pure water of
life, she facetiously remarked, addressing herself to Mr. Reed, "I
presume, Sir, we cannot calculate on your accompanying us to-morrow
to this unadorned house of prayer."</p>

<p>"Why not, Miss Holmes?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Sir, your clerical profession will lead you elsewhere!"</p>

<p>"I am happy to say, that I am not ashamed to go to offer up my
sacrifice of prayer and of praise in any place in which the God of
salvation will condescend to accept it. I prefer the village church to
the village chapel, most certainly; but, as I have no wish to become
a <em>dissenter</em>, I shall conform to the religious customs of the party
during our visit."</p>

<p>"A clergyman in a Dissenting chapel! The last wonder! Of
course, we must all be sworn to secrecy, and keep our pledge, or no
bishop will ordain you."</p>

<p>There is no indisposition under which the human frame labours
that assumes such a deceptive appearance as a consumption. In its
early stages it will often work so insidiously on the constitution,
that its subject is unconscious of its presence; and even, when it has
advanced to a very considerable extent, there are generally those
intervals of vigour and vivacity, that occasion sanguine expectations
of a recovery to be entertained even to the last. And it is during
these seasons, when the animal spirits return with great force&mdash;giving
a degree of energy and activity which is regarded as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
unequivocal proof of restored health, that exertions are made by
walking and by visiting, which often accelerate the fatal issue. To
confine to the house the invalid, who longs to breathe the fresh air,
or to keep her out of company, when the pleasures of social intercourse
relieve the spirits from languor, is a task which the kindness
of friendship cannot always perform; and hence she is often permitted
to run the risk of shortening her life by efforts which exhaust
her strength; or by exposures to the keen night air, which
give a fresh impetus to the disease. It was during one of these
intervals of renewed strength that Miss Holmes was induced to pay
a visit to a family, who resided about two miles off; and though
her father proposed to take her in a carriage, she preferred walking.
She reached her friends' house without feeling fatigued; after dinner
enjoyed a ramble in the country; and then, having taken tea,
returned to Dawlish. It was a pleasant evening, but the air was
rather cold; and though she bore the exertions of the day with
great cheerfulness, yet before she got home she began to feel exhausted.
On entering the drawing-room, she threw herself on the
sofa, and said, "I fear I have gone beyond my strength." After
resting herself some time, she retired for the night; but when she
awoke in the morning, instead of rising at her usual hour, she
requested to have her breakfast in bed. At noon she made her
appearance amongst the family, in apparently good spirits; but her
mother, who had watched the progress of her disorder with deep
anxiety, felt alarmed on seeing the hectic flush on her cheek, accompanied
by an occasional cough. Towards the evening the height of
her pulse was considerably increased; the palms of her hands became
dry and hot, and she complained of being chilly. These symptoms
excited fresh alarm; yet, as they came on immediately after the
fatigue of a long day's excursion, her friends flattered themselves
that they would go off when she had taken another night's rest; but
in this they were disappointed. On the following morning they
assumed a more threatening aspect; her cough became more troublesome,
the pain in her side returned, and though she appeared cheerful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
yet it was accompanied by an unusual gravity of look and manner.
At length it was judged expedient to call in a medical man,
who prescribed some medicines that afforded her a little temporary
relief. When asked for his opinion, he said, "I do not despair of her
recovery, though she must be very cautious. She must not exert
herself beyond her strength, nor yet expose herself to the night air."
The following letter, written to her friend Miss Martin, whom the
reader will remember accompanying Miss Holmes to call on Mrs.
Kent,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> exhibits the state of her mind at this critical period:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mary</span>,&mdash;An all-wise Providence has been pleased to
guide my steps once more to Dawlish, where we expect to spend a
few months. In revisiting it again, I naturally advert to that period
of my life when I was living in a state of alienation from God&mdash;devoted
to the pleasures and vanities of the world. Happy should I
now be to ramble with you through this beautiful country, and talk
of Him who lived and died for sinners; but, as that pleasure is
denied me, I will converse with you through a more circuitous
medium. You are aware that our journey here is mainly on my
account. On my arrival I grew much better, and continued for
some weeks to improve in my general health; but a short time ago
I caught a severe cold, and have never been well since. Though
my friends still cling to hope, as the sinking mariner hangs on the
broken plank of the vessel, till the returning wave comes to drive
him off, I am now very apprehensive as to the result. I know
that my heavenly Father can lengthen out the thread of my life,
and restore to full vigorous health the constitution which disease is
gradually wasting away; but I think He is about to remove me. It
costs, indeed, a hard struggle to view with composure the approach
of death at my age, and nothing could reconcile me to it but the
hope of immortality by which I feel animated and sustained. My
Alfred is with me, and his kind attentions often depress me. He
is still anticipating the day when he shall lead me to the altar; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
alas! fond youth, I am marked out as a victim for the grave! Yes!
and though I still feel I love him, yet I must give him up, and all
the prospects which open before me on this side the tomb, to go and
dwell with Him whom unseen I love! But 'thy will, O my Father,
be done!'</p>

<p>"Though I have received the sentence of death, I do not expect
that it will be executed speedily. No! I shall not be taken till all
are prepared to resign me; and till every tie is loosened which now
fastens my affections to 'things seen and temporal.' This is a kind
provision which our heavenly Father usually makes to afford some
alleviation to the sorrow of surviving friends; and to enable his
children to retire from this vale of life, without retaining any lingering
desires for a longer continuance in it.</p>

<p>"I have hitherto concealed from the eyes of others the most
alarming symptoms of my complaint, nor have I yet given them an
intimation of my own opinion; as I do not feel inclined to be at
present the bearer of such heavy tidings. They still try to amuse
me with the visions of futurity, and talk of my marriage with
Alfred, and all its attendant circumstances, as if length of days was
appointed for me: and though I feel conscious that a few months,
unless a miracle of mercy prevent, will change the theme of social
discourse, yet I cannot bring my mind to the severe trial of attempting
to banish these fond hopes and anticipations from others.</p>

<p>"I am happy to inform you that my dear sister Emma is become
decidedly pious. Her severe afflictions have had a salutary effect;
and now, being purified and softened by their influence, she exhibits
the features of the Christian character in all their attractive loveliness.
Her natural volatility and satirical humour are now transformed
to chastened vivacity and the sportive sallies of innocent
wit.</p>

<p>"I need not say how much I should enjoy your company at Dawlish,
if you could make it convenient to pay us a visit; but as that
is too great an indulgence for me to expect, you will not refuse me
the gratification of hearing from you as soon as possible. All here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
join me in kindest love to you, and your Papa and Mamma, who, I
trust, are both enjoying their usual good health.&mdash;I am, yours most
affectionately,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Louisa</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To this letter Miss Martin returned the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>15th September, 18&mdash;</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Louisa</span>,&mdash;I received yours of the 10th, but it is not
possible for me to describe the impressions which it produced on
my mind. I alternately wept tears of sorrow and of joy; and
though that overpowering excitement, which its first reading produced,
has somewhat subsided, yet I feel almost incapable of replying.
And is the wise Disposer of all events about to remove you
from amongst us? And have you, at such a comparatively early
period of the spiritual contest, fought the good fight of faith, and
gained the crown which fadeth not away? If so, I will say, 'Happy,
thrice happy saint!' thou art highly favoured of the Lord! Yes,
you will soon see the King in his beauty, and mingle your notes of
praise with the multitude around his throne! You will soon partake
of the fulness of joy, in which the spirits of the just made perfect
participate!</p>

<p>"But how can we give you up? How can we take this cup of
sorrow without praying that it may pass from us? How can we
offer up the prayer, 'Thy will, O Father, be done on earth, even as
it is done in heaven,' without feeling it quiver on our lips as we
attempt to utter it? I now find that entire resignation to the
Divine will, when those objects are placed in jeopardy on which
our affections are strongly fixed, is an attainment which I have not
yet acquired; and though I doubt not but the grace of Christ will
be found sufficient for its full display, when the day of trial comes,
yet, at the present moment, I am bowed down with so much heaviness
of soul that I cannot give vent to my feelings. What a contrast
do you exhibit! While I am restless, under the agitations
of fear, you are calm, in the anticipations of hope! While I am
praying that you may still be detained amongst us, to share our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
joys and our sorrows, you are fluttering on the wings of eager expectation,
ready to say, as you soar away from us, 'Weep not for
me, but weep for yourselves.' Happy spirit!</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear Louisa, your sweet composure at this awful
crisis&mdash;your bright anticipations, viewed in connection with your
attachment to your friends around you, have given me such an
exalted opinion of the efficacy of the Christian faith to sustain the
human spirit on the great occasions of its history, that I am not so
much astonished at your tranquil joy, as I am at my own timid
misgivings; and though I still hope I possess the faith which is
the evidence of things not seen, yet in me it is small, like the grain
of mustard seed, while in you it resembles the wide-spreading tree,
beneath whose branches you rest in safety.</p>

<p>"As you, my dear Louisa, when drawing nearer the closing scene,
may be subjected to the influence of the fears which not unfrequently
disturb the peace of the dying Christian, I have taken the
liberty of sending you an extract from a very interesting memoir,
which I have just read with great pleasure, and which, with a
degree of precision we rarely meet with in theological works, points
out the difference between faith and hope.</p>

<p>"'This difference,' the writer justly observes, 'is not always sufficiently
attended to; and much presumption on the one hand, and
despondency on the other, have arisen from confounding them. One
person considers himself a believer of high attainments, because he
entertains no doubt of his being in a state of salvation; and another
doubts whether he be a believer at all, because he cannot persuade
himself that his sins are forgiven. But it is obvious that two distinct
and very different acts of the mind are here confounded and
blended together;&mdash;one, which assents to the fact of Jesus Christ
being the only and all-sufficient Saviour of sinners; and which places
a reliance on the atoning sacrifice, for pardon of sin and acceptance
with God, which is the province of <em>faith</em>; and another, which appropriates
to itself the blessings of this salvation, and confidently
expects a future state of felicity, which is the province of <em>hope</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
Now, it is clear that these persuasions of the mind may exist separately
from each other; and that one of them may be very strong,
whilst the other has scarcely any existence at all. St. Paul clearly
recognizes this distinction, when he offers up a prayer for the Romans,
that the God of hope would fill them with all joy and peace
in believing. It is here implied that genuine faith may exist without
either joy or peace; and by addressing his prayer to 'the God
of hope,' he remarks that joy and peace are the fruits of hope, and
are distinct blessings to be superadded to the grace of faith.'</p>

<p>"I regret that it is not in my power to visit you at Dawlish,
but I assure you that I have you in my remembrance, when bowing
before the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and while I
pray that you may yet be spared to us, I do not forget to pray,
that if you are to be removed, you may be favoured with a joyful
entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.
You will present my kind affection to your dear parents, and your
sisters.&mdash;Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The alarming symptoms which immediately followed this return
of Miss Holmes' disorder, suddenly disappeared, and she was once
more restored to comparative health, though it was evident to all
her friends that the vigour of her constitution was greatly impaired.
She was again permitted to resume her rambles, and to breathe the
genial air of Dawlish, which once more enlivened her spirits. As
she now felt able to endure the fatigues of exertion, she was induced
to comply with the wishes of her kind friends in the country, to pay
them another visit. She rode there and back, and cautiously avoided
running any risk, either by too much exertion, or by any exposure
to damps or cold.</p>

<p>On reaching home, she changed her dress, and soon after retired
to rest; but on awakening in the morning, felt a hoarseness, accompanied
by a slight fever. She remained within for several days,
but on the following Sabbath, felt so much better that she ventured
to go to chapel, where she commemorated the death of the Redeemer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
This religious service she afterwards spoke of as one of the most
impressive and the happiest of her life. When adverting to it, in a
letter which she wrote to Mrs. Loader, she observed, "I have often
felt a great degree of solemnity and delight when receiving the sacramental
memorials of the Saviour's death; but last Sabbath, at
chapel, I felt a joy which was unspeakable and full of glory. When
the minister repeated the memorable words, 'This do in remembrance
of me,' I could not refrain from saying, in the language of Dr. Watts,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Why was I made to hear his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And enter while there's room;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thousands make a wretched choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And rather starve than come?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I think I have more than once alluded, in my free correspondence
with you, to my ceaseless dread of self-deception; and this makes
me hesitate to ascribe to a supernatural operation, the religious impressions
and tendencies of my heart; yet, on this occasion, I could
respond to the following declarations with perfect composure:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">''Twas the same love that spread the feast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sweetly forced me in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else I had still refused to taste,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And perished in my sin.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Till that morning a gloomy shade always darkened my prospects
of the future; but then the true light shone into me with such a
bright radiance, that I abounded in hope through the power of the
Holy Ghost. I retired from the hallowed service refreshed and invigorated;
and in the evening, when denied the privilege of returning
to the house of prayer, I made a more solemn surrender of myself
to God, than at any former period. What scenes of wonder
opened to my view! The Lord of life and glory expiring on the
cross! The high and lofty One condescending to admit a sinful
creature into his presence! The Saviour making intercession for
me! The gay and the thoughtless may pour contempt on the sublime
pleasures of devotion, and rush for happiness into a world which
abounds with evil; and under the spell of a fatal illusion, may imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
they have found it. But our joys would be ill exchanged for
theirs; and though it may not be in our power, while encompassed
with the infirmities of our nature, to perpetuate the vivid impressions
which we sometimes receive, yet they serve to demonstrate
the superlative value of the faith which originates them; and may
also tend to inspire within our breast an intense longing for that
fulness of joy in which the spirits of the just made perfect are allowed
to participate in the heavenly world."</p>

<p>A few days after Louisa's visit to the chapel, the symptoms of
her complaint returned with renewed violence. The physician was
again sent for, and on entering the room, she said, with a smile on
her countenance, "I am happy to see you, Sir; but I am now convinced
that my disorder is beyond your power to remove."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, it is; God can restore me if he please, but I do not
expect it."</p>

<p>He sat and conversed with her about a quarter of an hour, and
then left her.</p>

<p>"Pray, Sir," said Mrs. Holmes, "what is your opinion?"</p>

<p>"She is very ill, Madam."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is a confirmed consumption?"</p>

<p>"I do. I fear the disease has made great progress."</p>

<p>"Do you think that a longer continuance in the country will
prove beneficial to the dear sufferer?"</p>

<p>"To be candid, Madam, I do not think that it is in the power of
human means to arrest the progress of the disease, though a judicious
course of management may greatly alleviate her sufferings."</p>

<p>"Do you think, Sir, she can be removed without much inconvenience
to herself?"</p>

<p>"She may, in the course of a few days, when her strength rallies;
but I am clearly of opinion, that if you wait much longer, it will
be impossible to remove her."</p>

<p>This information came as a death-blow to the hopes of all the
family. Mrs. Holmes, with Jane and Emma, sobbed aloud. A more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
silent though not less poignant grief marked the countenances of
her father and Mr. Reed. "If she must die," said her father, "she
had better be taken home to die." "My Louisa die! My dear
Louisa die!" said Alfred, clasping his hands in an intensity of
anguish, "And must she die? and must she be taken from me?" At
length he became more composed, when informed by Mrs. Holmes
that Louisa had just awaked out of a sweet sleep, much revived, and
wished to see him. The family sat conversing together the whole
of the evening, and arranged the plan for returning to the Elms,
whither they determined to proceed immediately.</p>

<p>For the space of a fortnight after her return home, Miss Holmes
continued to improve so rapidly in appearance that the hope of life
began to beam once more upon all except herself. At this time she
wrote the following letter to Miss Martin, who had now gone with
her parents to Hastings for a short period:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mary</span>,&mdash;A kind Providence has permitted me to see
the Elms once more, and once more to commune with my absent
friend from my own room, a privilege which I could not have anticipated
a few weeks since. After the reception of your kind letter,
my disorder took a turn, and we again thought that the bitterness
of death was passed; but in the midst of our joy the symptoms reappeared,
and I was brought near to the grave. I have again revived,
but it is only to protract my course for a little time longer.
I may live through the winter, and I may live to see another spring
opening with all its beauties, but I do not expect it. The symptoms
of death are upon me. The silver cord is broken, and my affections
are dying off from earth. I am beginning to feel as a stranger
amongst my most endeared friends and relatives; and though their
sorrows excite my sympathy, yet I have no wish to remain here
longer. No! I hear a voice they do not hear, and see a form of
beauty they cannot see. I long to depart. I can look through my
window on the walks which wind round our shrubbery, without
wishing to retrace my former footsteps. I can muse on the pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
which I have enjoyed in the social circle, without desiring to taste
them again. I still feel that I am a sinner&mdash;an unworthy sinner;
my perceptions of the evil of sin are more clear and affecting than
at any former period of my life; and at times I am almost overwhelmed
by the indescribable manifestations of the Divine purity;
but it hath pleased God to impart to me corresponding views of the
efficacy of the precious blood of Christ, so that I have no fears ruffling
my peace. I am entering the valley, but it is not dark: nor do
I hear any sounds but those of Mercy's voice. The enemy has not
yet been suffered to stir up his strength against me, nor have I been
once tempted to mistrust either the fidelity of the Saviour, or his
willingness to save me. I thank you for the extract which you sent
me. It defines the essential difference between faith and hope with
great accuracy and precision; but I have now done with all human
compositions. The only book I now read is the Bible. This is the
fountain from whence I now draw the pure water of life; and though
I feel thankful for the writings of those good men which have contributed
to my spiritual improvement and consolation, yet, like
withered flowers, they have lost their beauty and their fragrance.</p>

<p>"I do not think that I should have preferred any other period of
my existence for my departure, to the present, even if I had been
permitted to choose. If I had been taken earlier, I should have left
some of my relatives in the gall of bitterness; and if spared longer,
I might have left some hapless children; but now I can embrace all
as fellow-heirs of the grace of life, who are nearly allied to me by
the ties of nature, and I can quit the world without leaving any
chasm which may not soon be closed. My friends will weep over
my grave, but the hope of a re-union in a better world will mitigate
the violence of their sorrow; and soon the days of their mourning
will be ended, and earth will be exchanged for heaven.</p>

<p>"Farewell, my dear friend; but only for a season. We are soon
to be separated, but we shall meet again. With kind remembrance
to all.&mdash;Your dying friend,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Louisa</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Holmes had now another relapse, which destroyed all hope
of her recovery. Addressing her mother, who was communicating,
in a low voice, to Mr. Reed the opinion of the physician, she said,
"You need not whisper, I have long known that I should not recover;
and now <em>you</em> know it, let us converse together as those who are on
the eve of parting."</p>

<p>"I have long feared it," said Mrs. Holmes, "though I have been
unable to express my fears."</p>

<p>"But why, my dear Mamma, should you fear it? Death has lost
its sting. The grave has lost its gloom. I am merely preceding
you, and preceding you under the most auspicious circumstances."</p>

<p>"Then has my dear Louisa no dread of death?"</p>

<p>"No. I have outlived that dread of dying which once bowed down
my spirits; and can smile on the king of terrors, who now appears
transformed into an angel of deliverance."</p>

<p>"But have you," said Mr. Reed, "no wish to live?"</p>

<p>"I had, Alfred, but now I have not. I once wished to live to share
your sorrows and your joys, and animate you in the discharge of
your sacred duties; but now I wish to depart and be with Christ,
which is far better."</p>

<p>On seeing her mother and sisters weep, she said, "I am not surprised
by your tears, because, if either of you were in my place, I
should weep. I know that nature must give vent to her feelings;
but you cannot expect <em>me</em> to weep. Weep I cannot, unless I shed
the tear of grateful joy. No! My days of weeping are passed away;
and soon my days of suffering will be over."</p>

<p>Though her disease had been for some time making rapid progress
towards the fatal issue, her spirits were yet buoyant, and occasionally
she was as energetic and cheerful as in former days. One evening,
when the family were sitting with her, she talked with a vivacity
and fluency which induced them to hope that she might be
spared to them for some months, if not years longer. While indulging
these expectations, they were aroused from their reverie by the
sudden entrance of Emma, who brought her the following letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
from her friend Mrs. Loader, which the postman had just delivered:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;The affectionate letter which I have just
received from dear Emma, brings the mournful intelligence of your
relapse, and that now all hope of your recovery has vanished away.
This intelligence, though mournful to others, is not, I am thankful
to hear, a cause of sorrow to yourself. You are now on Pisgah,
with the dreary wilderness behind you; and the goodly land of promise
in view, overshadowed by no darkening cloud. My sympathies
I reserve for others; to you, I offer my congratulations. The contest
is over; the victory is won, and ere long you will receive the
fadeless crown of immortality. In a few weeks or days, you, who
are now an inhabitant of earth, will be a glorified spirit, beholding
the face of the Holy One, and uniting with the saints in heaven in
the grand chorus of adoration and praise. What you will then feel,
on looking back on the scene through which you are now passing;
or how you will give expression to your thoughts and emotions, is
beyond all power of conjecture; but it is sufficient to be assured
that you will be perfectly happy, and released from all earthly
cares and anxieties. Happy spirit!&mdash;happy, because redeemed;&mdash;happy,
because brought in safety to the end of your pilgrimage;&mdash;and
happy, now that the shadow of death is flitting across your
path&mdash;the visible sign of the coming of your Lord, to take you to
himself. Adieu, my much-loved friend, but not for ever; the hope
of a re-union sustains the dying and the living. We shall weep
when <em>you</em> are rejoicing with the spirits of the just amid the unfading
glories of the celestial world.</p>

<p>"The Lord be with you. Again I say adieu, my much-loved
friend; but only for a season. My love and sympathy to all the
dear members of your family.&mdash;Ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">E. Loader</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Miss Holmes read this letter, shed a few tears, and then presented
it to Emma, saying, "When the crisis is over, acknowledge for me
receipt of it; and tell Mrs. Loader what pleasure it gave me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>The tide of life was now rapidly ebbing; and on her father entering
her room, a few days after receiving Mrs. Loader's letter, she
stretched forth her hand, and said, "I hope you are prepared to resign
me, for I have not long to be with you."</p>

<p>"I have had," he replied, "a hard struggle to do it; but the Lord
has at length enabled me to say, 'Even so, for so it seemeth good in
thy sight.'"</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it; and I hope you will all be enabled to feel
the same resignation to the Divine will. I wish you would now pray
with me, that I may be strengthened in my soul to endure the last
struggle." When this hallowed and deeply affecting exercise was
ended, she reclined her head on the pillow, and slept for two hours.
When she awoke, she rose up in her bed, and casting a smile on all
around her, said, "My sleep has refreshed me." After giving a few
directions respecting her funeral, she delivered the keys of her desk,
&amp;c., to her mother, with a request that she would distribute the few
trifling presents she had marked for her friends, and then added,
"Now I have done with earth. Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly!"
As she gave utterance to this prayer, her countenance beamed with
an indescribable glow of rapture, and with a gentle bending of the
neck, she bid all farewell, her lips distinctly articulating, "Precious
Saviour! thou art come," as they were closing in perpetual silence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sketch which I have exhibited of Miss Holmes' character and
religious experience, has been taken from real life; and though on
some points her experience may differ from that of the pious reader,
yet that circumstance will not diminish the degree of interest which
may be felt on examining it. We see what human nature is, even
with all the advantages of a pious education, before the great spiritual
change takes place; we see the process which is observed in the
production of this change&mdash;the evidences by which it is attested&mdash;the
various and the numerous conflicts which the subject of it has
to encounter, while passing through this vale of tears&mdash;and the
influence which a pure faith in the efficacy of the atonement has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
in sustaining the mind in affliction, and in the prospect of death.
And who can turn away from such a scene, without wishing to be
made a partaker of the like precious faith? and without exclaiming,
"Let me die the death of the righteous?" Compare Miss Holmes'
character with that of the devotee of fashion; compare the uniform
tranquillity of her mind, after she had obtained peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ, with the restless uneasiness which
agitates the gay; compare her death with the death of the thoughtless
and the trifling, and what will be the result? What! a firm
conviction must be produced, that the religion of the Scriptures,
when it is brought to operate on the human mind, does more to
elevate and refine it, and prepare it for its final destiny, than all
the discoveries of science, all the speculations of philosophy, or all
the boasted triumphs of reason. This is a fact, which is not merely
supported by opinion, but also by the evidence of experience and
testimony; and though it may not excite that degree of attention
which its importance demands, yet the period may not be far distant
when the reader will feel the force of it. Yes, the hour may
not be far distant, when you may be called away from that circle in
which you are now moving, and from those scenes of pleasure which
now captivate and hold you in subjection; to bid farewell to lover
and to friend, and let go your hold of life. Yes, the hour may not
be far distant, when you will feel yourself entering an eternal
world, when the solemnities of the final judgment will open upon
you in all their awful grandeur, and when conscience, roused from
her long repose of guilty quietude, will speak to condemn. Yes, the
hour may not be far distant, when the raptures of bliss, or the
agonies of despair, will be yours, and yours for ever. And will
you remain in a state of indifference, while such solemn events are
at hand? Will you pass on to meet them, as though they were
cunningly devised fables? Can no argument produce a conviction
of your danger, and can no motive induce you to avoid it? Will
you resolutely withstand all the efforts which are made to save you
from going down to death unprepared to meet your God? and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
resolutely devote yourselves to the follies and the amusements of
the world, as though you were to live for ever? God forbid!</p>

<p>But I hope that the intelligent reader has felt that moral renovation
of heart, without which all the attainments of the purest morality
will prove unavailing; and is looking for pardon and eternal life
through faith in the death and mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
If so, though you may have your occasional fears respecting your
personal interest in him; though you may often dread, lest at some
future period, the deep impressions under which you now labour
should be effaced from your mind; and though you may even start
back from the approach of death, as from the visitations of a destroying
angel, yet He who has begun the good work will carry it
on&mdash;He who has drawn you into fellowship with himself will perpetuate
it&mdash;He who has inclined you to hope in his mercy will
sustain that hope in the final hour, and give you a peaceful entrance
into the joy of your Lord.</p>

<p>Go, then, to the footstool of the Divine throne, and there offer up
the sacrifice of praise to Him who has made you alive from the dead,
and yield yourself unto God, and your end will be everlasting life.
You may be reproached for such an act of decision&mdash;you may be
contemned&mdash;you may excite the pity of some, and the sarcasm of
others; but you will not repent the course you have taken, especially
when your latter end approaches. Reflecting, then, on your past
career in the world you are just quitting, and directing your anticipations
forward to that on which you are entering, you will feel an
elevation of soul which no remembrances can depress, and without
a sigh of regret, or emotion of fear, will close your eyes in peace.</p>

<p>And when the conflict is over, and you have gained the prize of
immortality&mdash;when you have undergone the anticipated assimilation
to the likeness of God, and are as perfect in purity and knowledge
as in blessedness&mdash;beholding the person and the glory of the dear
Redeemer&mdash;uniting with the innumerable multitude around his
throne, in their anthems of adoration and praise&mdash;you will then feel,
that in being a redeemed sinner, you have experienced greater manifestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
of Divine favour and love, than if you had been created
from the first an angel of the highest order. And in your then
glorified state you will often advert to your earthly sojourn&mdash;to your
sins and to your sorrows&mdash;retracing the mysterious path of your
Christian course, with the ineffably joyful consciousness pervading
your heart, that you have not again to suffer, or to sin; that you
have not again to pass through "death's dark vale," or again to
dread the possibility of perishing; but to live for ever in the full
enjoyment of unmingled happiness. Then, with what emotions of
gratitude will you adore and bless God for having made you, when
in this world, refrain from following the example of the gay and
thoughtless; who, alas! will then be where the voice of mercy is
never heard, and where the light of hope never dawns!</p>

<h2>THE HAPPY MARRIAGE.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_478.jpg" alt="D" width="100" height="110" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">During all this time that has elapsed, what has become
of our friends at Fairmount?</p>
</div>

<p>The reader has now probably conjectured from the
account of my visit to Fairmount at Christmas,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that
a marriage would ere long take place between Mr. Lewellin and
Miss Roscoe. It had been arranged in a subsequent visit paid by
Mr. Lewellin at Easter, that the wedding should take place in the
following June, and preparations were already made for the joyful
occasion, at which I was invited to be present. On returning to
London, however, to adjust some business matters, Mr. Lewellin
found to his dismay, that an affair of great importance, which even
threatened the stability of the mercantile house with which he was
connected, required him immediately to proceed to Australia. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
disappointment and vexation thus occasioned to the youthful lovers
may be conceived, but there was no alternative, and the wedding
was accordingly postponed to the following spring, by which time
it was hoped that the bridegroom would have returned. Unfortunately,
however, the business which required Mr. Lewellin's attention
at the Antipodes, proved of so tedious and protracted a nature,
that instead of reaching home in the spring, as he expected, nearly
two years elapsed before he could return to his native country. In
the interval poor Miss Holmes, Miss Roscoe's attached friend, died,
as I have narrated in the foregoing chapter, and her loss was deeply
felt by Sophia. During Miss Holmes' last illness, Miss Roscoe was
on a tour in Italy with her father and mother; and though her
friend had been suffering from a severe cold when she quitted England,
Sophia had no idea of the fatal issue to which this would lead,
and frequently anticipated, during her travels, the pleasure with
which, on her return, she would describe to Louisa the beautiful
scenery and objects of interest she had seen while abroad. As
Mr. and Mrs. Roscoe and Sophia travelled much in Italy, seldom
staying long in one place, their correspondence with their friends
in England was very irregularly maintained, and, consequently, no
tidings of Miss Holmes' illness reached them; and it was not till
passing through London, on their return from the Continent, that
they learned, to their grief and dismay, that Louisa had expired
about a fortnight previously. Before proceeding to Watville, they
paid a visit to the Elms, and did their utmost to console the bereaved
family. They were also very urgent in pressing Emma and
Jane to pay them a visit, which the feelings of the latter would not
permit them to do at the time, but they expressed their readiness
to do so as soon as their minds were somewhat more composed.</p>

<p>Not long after Miss Roscoe's return home, her spirits were most
unexpectedly revived by the arrival of Mr. Lewellin, who having
brought his business to a satisfactory termination, had immediately
thereafter stepped on board ship and reached England, a few days
before the letter which he had sent to announce his return. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
joy of the youthful pair at meeting again, after so long a separation,
is more easily imagined than described. Preparations were now
made for the consummation of their union, at which I was earnestly
invited to be present, but the multiplicity of my pastoral engagements
prevented me from doing so, much to my regret. I, however,
readily promised to pay a visit at Fairmount as soon as the married
couple should have returned from their wedding tour.</p>

<p>At first it had been decided that the young people should settle
in the vicinity of London, and that Mr. Lewellin should continue
his mercantile pursuits as formerly, but this plan was ultimately
abandoned. "I presume," said Mr. Roscoe to Mr. Stevens, when
they met to adjust the final arrangements, "that your nephew will
inherit your property, as my daughter will inherit mine, when it
shall please God to remove us to a better world; and if so, I think
they will possess a fortune quite large enough, without running the
risk of losing any part of it by the speculations of commerce, and
without encumbering themselves with the difficulties and anxieties
necessarily attendant on them."</p>

<p>"This question," replied Mr. Stevens, "has often engrossed my
attention, and I am happy to find that our sentiments on it coincide."</p>

<p>While Mr. Stevens and Mr. Roscoe were thus debating this grave
subject, and determining what income they would portion off for the
young people, they were disturbed by the sudden entrance of Mr.
Lewellin and the ladies, who were ignorant of the point under discussion.
"You two gentlemen look very grave," said Mrs. Stevens;
"one would almost suppose that you have been discussing some
question in which the destinies of Europe are involved."</p>

<p>"No, Madam," said Mr. Roscoe, "we have not been agitating
any such question, but another, if not of equal importance, yet of
equal interest to you."</p>

<p>"And what may that be, Sir?"</p>

<p>"I see your curiosity is awakened; but cannot you restrain it for
a few hours, till you can coax your husband to gratify it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Sir, a woman very naturally feels anxious to know what,
when known, will deeply interest her; and though you gentlemen
sometimes practise the art of tantalizing, yet you must admit, that
we can easily get at your secrets. When together, you can keep up
the game; but when you separate, you give up the prize. You glory
in your strength, when supported by each other's courage; but
alone, you soon surrender."</p>

<p>"Ah! so it is; we, the lords of the creation, are compelled to pay
tribute."</p>

<p>"Of course, Sir, tribute to whom tribute is due."</p>

<p>"To CÃ¦sar, Madam!"</p>

<p>"And to CÃ¦sar's wife, Sir."</p>

<p>"I see you are restless; and as I have too much compassion to
keep you on the rack, I will announce in due form the question
which we have been agitating. It is this&mdash;Shall your nephew and
my daughter, after a certain event takes place, go to reside near
London, or shall they reside near us?"</p>

<p>"A question, I presume, Sir, no less interesting to you than myself."</p>

<p>"Equally so, Madam."</p>

<p>"And how have you decided it, Sir?"</p>

<p>"We have come to no decision; but we should prefer their settling
near us, rather than going so far away."</p>

<p>"I am happy to hear you are of that opinion; it completely coincides
with my own views. I was always averse to George and
Sophia being settled at a distance from us."</p>

<p>The reader will no doubt remember Miss Denham, whose death
I narrated in a previous part of the book.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Her mother did not
long survive the melancholy event; and Mr. Denham, being now
left alone, soon sank into a morbid melancholy, which embittered
his last days. He had outlived nearly all the companions of his
youth; followed those to the grave who were to have inherited his
property; and after languishing in a state of mental gloom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
depression for several years, he bowed his head and gave up the
ghost. His property, which consisted principally of land, he ordered
to be sold, and the proceeds to be divided amongst his poor
relations, with the exception of a small estate which he bequeathed
to an intimate friend. Mr. Roscoe became the purchaser of one of
his estates, which was situated in the parish of Broadhurst, not far
from Mr. Ingleby's rectory; and as the gentleman who had rented
it had just resolved on removing to a more distant part of the
country, Mr. Roscoe deemed it a most eligible location for the
young people. It consisted of a good house, very pleasantly situated,
with about eighty acres of arable and pasture land, well wooded
and watered.</p>

<p>When it was known that Mr. Roscoe had made this purchase,
Farmer Pickford called on him with the view of obtaining a lease
of it for his son Harry.</p>

<p>"I hear, Sir, as how you have bought one of the farms belonging
to Mr. Denham; and I have made so bold as to call and say, I can
get you a goodish sort of a tenant if you should want one. One
that will do justice to the land, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"And who is it you have been thinking of?"</p>

<p>"My son Harry. He'll make as good a farmer as his father, and
that is saying a good deal; though, perhaps, I shouldn't blow my
own trumpet. I will stand score for the rent, and the proper tillage
of the farm."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Farmer, for your offer; and I should have much
pleasure in accepting your son as a tenant, but I have purchased the
farm with an intention of offering it to Mr. Lewellin, if he should
feel disposed to become a farmer."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, Sir; I hope no offence. I wouldn't have said a
word, if I had known that. Howsomever, I shall be glad to have
him for a neighbour; and anything I can do to sarve him, I shall
have a power of pleasure in doing."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Farmer. He will need instruction beyond what I can
give him; and I had resolved to call on you for a little advice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>"That, Sir, I will give at any time, with a power of pleasure."</p>

<p>"It is pretty good land, I believe, Farmer?"</p>

<p>"The land, Sir, has a good heart in itself; but it has been desperately
run out. It will take a power of trouble and expense to bring
it into a good working condition, and no mistake. Mr. Denham
was a bad landlord. He never would make no improvements, nor
help his tenant to make any. And I always find a bad landlord
makes a bad tenant."</p>

<p>"I am very glad, Farmer, that you have called, and have referred
to your son Harry; and I will now tell you what has been running
in my mind. I know the farm has been mismanaged, and that it will
require, as you say, much trouble and expense to bring it into a
good working condition; now, could you not spare your son Harry
for a year or two, to act as bailiff to Mr. Lewellin; and thus he will
be doing something for himself, which you know won't prevent him
from taking a farm, when you have an opportunity of doing so?"</p>

<p>"It shall be, Sir, as you say."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you and your son had better call in the course of a
few days, and we will settle the terms of agreement."</p>

<p>"With a power of satisfaction. This will mainly please my mistress,
and Harry too, and no mistake."</p>

<p>Farmer Pickford then took his leave, and Mr. Roscoe proceeded to
Fairmount to acquaint the family with the projects he had in view,
in which they all gladly acquiesced. "Indeed, George," said Mrs.
Stevens, addressing herself to Mr. Lewellin, "I think you will sustain
no loss by exchanging the smoke of London for the salubrious
air of Rockhill, and may part with your prospects of civic honours
without regret, to be enrolled on the list of country gentlemen.
Though you may not at first be so expert in farming as in mercantile
transactions, yet in process of time your rural occupations will
be no less interesting, if not quite so profitable."</p>

<p>"The exchange, Aunt, will be made without regret, especially
when made in accordance with the wishes of my friends."</p>

<p>"We all wish it," said Mrs. Roscoe, who had accompanied her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
husband to Fairmount; "and it quite reconciles me to the idea of
parting with my dear Sophia."</p>

<p>In the course of a few months Mr. Lewellin disposed of his business
in London; the house at Rockhill underwent a thorough repair,
and was neatly furnished, Harry Pickford was duly installed into
his office, the farm stocked with the usual variety of live cattle,
and the day for the celebration of the nuptial ceremony fixed. At
length the wedding morning dawned, when the sun shone without
a cloud, a circumstance which Sophia's good old nurse hailed as a
happy omen of her future happiness. Every one was astir at an
early hour. The friends invited to the wedding arrived, and the
bride, with her father and mother and the rest of her party, drove
off to the rectory, where they found Mr. Lewellin and Mr. and Mrs.
Stevens and their friends waiting to receive them. "I am happy,"
said the venerable Rector, "that I have lived to see this day; and
more happy that Divine Providence has conferred on me the office
of uniting you in the bands of matrimony."</p>

<p>He then knelt down and prayed with them, and as he prayed
warm tears were shed, but they were not tears of sorrow. Prayer
being ended, they at once proceeded to the church. The good old
Rector, dressed in the habiliments of his office, walked first, followed
by the bride leaning on her father's arm and the rest of the
marriage party. On entering the church they passed direct to the
altar, where the ceremony was performed by Mr. Ingleby with great
solemnity, in presence of a larger concourse of people than had been
remembered in the village on such an occasion for many years. As
soon as it was finished, the married pair proceeded to the vestry to
attach their signatures to the register of their marriage, when Mr.
Ingleby thus addressed them:&mdash;"I hope you will enjoy the excursion
you are about to take; that a kind Providence will watch over
you, to preserve you from all evil; and that you will return to us in
health and peace. Accept this small packet as a token of the interest
I feel in your happiness, and possibly you may retain it as a
relic of friendship long after I have left you for a better world."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
He then placed it in the hands of Mrs. Lewellin, saying, "You may
open and examine it at your leisure." On re-entering the church,
they were both unexpectedly greeted by the village choir, who sung
in sweetest melody the 128th Psalm, from Sternhold and Hopkin's
version&mdash;</p>

THE BRIDAL PARTY WELCOMED BY THE VILLAGERS.</p>

<p>Vol. ii. page 456.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The bridal party on coming out of the church were received with
acclamations by the assembled rustics, who, all attired in their holiday
clothes, thronged the churchyard, and pressed forward to wish
the new married couple a long and a happy life. Nothing could
more unequivocally testify to the universal popularity with which
Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin were regarded among the villagers. The
bells in the old tower rung forth their merriest peals, while the village
children, with their little baskets, strewed the path with
flowers. On reaching the churchyard gate, the wedding party
stepped into the carriages which were waiting for them, and drove
off to Mr. Roscoe's mansion. There the young couple proceeded to
dress for their journey; and having partaken of some refreshment,
left for the usual tour. The wedding party were entertained at
dinner, by Mr. and Mrs. Roscoe, in celebration of the joyous occasion:
while the company was cheerful and lively, there was no appearance
of that levity which too often attends the celebration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
the nuptial vow, even amongst the decidedly pious. "There are
some of the customs of the world," said the venerable Rector,
"which a Christian may follow without in the least compromising
his character; I shall therefore offer no apology for giving the following
toast&mdash;'<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin, and may they live long
on earth, and finish their course with joy</span>.'" This toast was
duly honoured by the whole party, who soon afterwards retired to
the drawing-room, where the remainder of the day was spent in
innocent festivity and social intercourse. A sumptuous rustic feast
was likewise spread on the lawn for the villagers, who were thus
furnished with the means of participating with their superiors in
the general rejoicings of the day.</p>

<p>We now return to the wedded couple. "I wonder," said Mrs.
Lewellin, as they rode along in the post-chaise, "what this packet
contains: I must open it, and have my curiosity gratified. Ah!"
said she, on discovering its contents, "it is just like Mr. Ingleby, he
is always so kind and considerate. Here is his pastoral advice to
us, who have just returned from the altar." She then proceeded to
read to her husband as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am happy, my dear young friends, that, in the union which has
taken place this day, there has been no sacrifice of Christian principle&mdash;no
violation of filial duty, and that it has been consummated
under the most auspicious circumstances. You are both, my young
friends, fellow-heirs of the grace of life; so that you have each
obeyed the Divine injunction by marrying in the Lord. Here are
your parents and your guardians offering you their congratulations,
while Providence is opening before you a scene of prosperity, which,
I trust, you will ever continue to enjoy. But you will not find this
world a paradise; nor will you be allowed to pass through it without
meeting with trials. It is not my wish, certainly, on this joyful
occasion, to darken your prospects with the shades of threatening
evil, but permit me, an old man on the brink of the grave, to
address a few words to you, which may be of service after I have
gone to rest with my fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ever remember that you are both imperfect Christians, which
will keep you from forming extravagant expectations, and guard you
against the depressing influence of those momentary disappointments
which you may feel. It is generally admitted, by the most
competent judges, that temper is the hinge on which the happiness
of domestic life turns; and if you can contrive to keep this
always in a good condition, you will never be disturbed by the
gratings of discontent, or the harsher sounds of anger or of discord.
You are, I believe, both amiable, and have, during a long courtship,
preserved the equilibrium of your temper&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ne'er roughen'd by those cataracts and breaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which humour, interposed, too often makes;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">yet you have now entered on a course in which you will find the
correctness of the poet's remark exemplified&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The kindest and the happiest pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will find occasion to forbear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And something, every day they live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pity, and perhaps forgive.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I have known some who have been very fond of each other before
marriage, and for some time after it, but their affection has gradually
dwindled into indifference, even while they have been unconscious
of any change. This is an evil against which I wish you to be on
your guard. You may now suppose that such an event cannot occur;
but what <em>has</em> befallen others <em>may</em> befal you. Pure love is a delicate
plant, which suffers by neglect; and though you may imagine that
by virtue of its inherent strength, it will perpetually yield the
fragrance and the fruit of conjugal felicity, yet it will not do so without
the most assiduous care. Endeavour, then, ever to exercise towards
each other an amiable and forbearing temper, which will make
you appear no less lovely in each other's estimation when the gray
hairs of age come upon you, than when in the full bloom of youthful
vigour.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"But if pure affection may be regarded as the foundation on which
domestic happiness rests, it is the province of good sense to raise the
superstructure&mdash;to decorate and embellish it&mdash;to secure its internal
harmony, and to cast up those mounds and bulwarks which will protect
it from external annoyance and danger. I do not know that I
can define this expression better than by calling it, that sense of propriety
which is suited to the situation in which the member of a
family is placed. Good sense will teach you to keep your proper
station in your family; when to see and when not to see the faults
and the excellencies of others; when and how to administer reproof,
or to give commendation; and how to uphold your authority without
the appearance of severity. It will also induce you to pay great
attention to the little things of domestic life, which exercise so
material an influence in promoting its happiness.</p>

<p>"As <em>your</em> manners will have a material influence over all the subordinate
members of your household, the exercise of your good sense
will teach you the importance of keeping your proper station, lest
you should, by an act of encroachment, give excitement to any evil
tempers or dispositions, which the occasion may appear to justify. I
am aware of the extreme difficulty of marking out the exact boundary
within which you ought to keep in the exercise of your authority,
or in your habit of personal inspection; but as an improper
interference with the opinions or the prescribed duties of others very
rarely fails to give offence, even when no offence is intended, good
sense will keep you on your guard against rousing unnecessarily irritable
feelings. I do not wish you to suffer your servants to govern
you, nor do I wish you to stand in awe of them, as I am convinced,
from long observation, that the sceptre of authority should be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
by the heads of a family; but as your comfort will depend very materially
on those by whom you are served, I would advise you to
study their temper and their disposition, and so to shape your commands
as to secure obedience without a murmur, and bring about
reform without opposition. Remember that your servants are not
slaves, to be governed by authority without reason&mdash;that they are
not stoics, to be treated as though they had no feeling; but are your
equals in relation to God, though your inferiors in relation to civil
society&mdash;who have as strong a claim on your generosity, as you have
on their fidelity, and who will in general reward your kindness and
sympathy by their affection and grateful obedience.</p>

<p>"If there be one sight more lovely than another in the present
world, that sight is a happy family, whose different members live
together in love and in peace, bearing each other's burdens, anticipating
each other's wants, and endeavouring, by the thousand nameless
expressions of kindness which they may show to each other, to
secure and augment each other's felicity.</p>

<p>"As you are both disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, you will, I
have no doubt, erect an altar of devotion in your habitation; but
you must guard against the supposition, that all the duties of family
religion are discharged when you have presented the morning and
evening sacrifice. You may have servants to instruct who are ignorant
of the nature and design of the gospel of peace, or whose positive
aversion to every form of religion renders remonstrance or persuasion
necessary. Though you may imagine that the instruction
of the pulpit will prove the means of removing their prejudices, and
imparting to them clear perceptions of the truth as it is in Jesus,
yet I would advise you not to trust entirely to it. A little private
conversation with them, when a favourable opportunity occurs, or
a few familiar remarks made before or after reading a portion of the
Scriptures, when you are collected together for the purpose of family
prayer, may have a powerful effect on their minds, and lead them to
work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. And if you
should be instrumental in bringing any of them to repentance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
to the knowledge of the truth, you will have an ample compensation
for your anxiety and labour, in the more ardent attachment which
they will feel for you, and the greater fidelity with which they will
serve you.</p>

<p>"I have more than once heard it remarked, that social intimacy
very often proves injurious to that intimate Christian fellowship, on
which the growth, if not the vitality of personal religion very materially
depends. Hence, husbands and wives, parents and children,
frequently converse more freely on the experimental influence of
religion with distant associates or comparative strangers than with
each other. But this ought not to be. They who are animated by
the like precious faith, and who have to encounter the same spiritual
difficulties, ought not to suffer the closeness of their union to operate
as a reason why they should hold no spiritual communion with each
other. Let me then entreat you, now you are just on the eve of
forming your domestic habits, to avoid this evil, into which too
many fall; and by the most unreserved mental communications,
become helpers of each other's faith and hope.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If pains afflict, or wrongs oppress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If cares distract, or fears dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If guilt deject, or sin distress,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">do not lock up your grief as a profound secret, which a false delicacy
may wish you to conceal from one another; but rather disclose
it without reserve, and you will meet in your reciprocal sympathy a
relief from your burden of sorrow. And that you may cultivate
this intimate religious fellowship, allow me to suggest to you the
adoption of a habit, which I think eminently conducive to your
spiritual prosperity. Always retire, during some part of the day or
the evening, to pray <em>with each other</em>, and for each other; and you
will find that the line of the poet records a fact, which your own
experience will soon attest to be true, that prayer</p>

<p class="center">
'Brings ev'ry blessing from above.'
</p>

<p class="noind">It enriches the mind with the treasures of spiritual wisdom, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
it imparts a sweetness to the disposition, and an amiability to the
temper, which cares and anxieties will not impair.</p>

<p>"And though, my young friends, I cannot cheer you with the
hope of being able to pass through life without coming into contact
with its temptations, its disappointments, and its bereavements, yet
He in whom you trust, and to whom you have both devoted yourselves
in the spring-time of your life, will never leave you nor forsake
you, but will be a very present help in every time of trouble.
If you are spared till the time of old age, I trust you will be 'like a
tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth fruit in his
season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall
prosper.' And if you should be removed in early life, you will be
transplanted to that celestial paradise, where you will flourish in undecaying
strength and glory for ever. It is but a little while that I
shall live on earth as a spectator of your bliss; but if spirits are allowed
in their disembodied state to visit, though unseen, the abodes
of mortals, I shall often be with you, 'joying and beholding your
order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.'"</p>

<h2>AN OLD FRIENDSHIP REVIVED.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_491.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">After a delightful tour through the west of England,
and part of South Wales, Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin arrived
at Malvern, where they intended to remain for
some time previous to returning home. On the Saturday
after their arrival, in ascending the hill behind the town, they
passed two ladies, when Mrs. Lewellin said, "I think I know the
tallest; she appears to be an invalid, and, to judge from her fixed
look, I should infer that she had a faint recognition of myself."</p>
</div>

<p>They turned back to pass them again, if possible, but they lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
sight of them in the little crowd of fashionables enjoying their
morning promenade. As they were sauntering along on their return
to their hotel, they passed what appeared to be a small place
of worship, and on making inquiries, they found it was a Dissenting
chapel.</p>

<p>"We ought," Mr. Lewellin remarked, "to be devoutly thankful
to Divine Providence for raising up so many of these unobtrusive
little sanctuaries&mdash;they are the retreats of the gospel, when it is
driven out from the Established Church, as is too often the case."</p>

<p>"To me," replied his wife, "any place is a Bethel, if its walls echo
to the name of Jesus."</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath. They were seated near the door
of the chapel, when they saw the two ladies enter whom they had
observed on the preceding day; but as they passed on to occupy a
pew near to the pulpit, they could not get a sight of the face of
either of them. The service was conducted as usual with extreme
simplicity&mdash;singing, without the aid of any instrumental music, and
extemporary prayer, free, however, from monotony or tautology.
The sermon was short and impressive, setting forth the grand
truths of revelation in a simple, earnest manner, and enforcing
them in tones of mild, persuasive, yet commanding eloquence. The
text would be considered by many a very commonplace one, yet it is
one which embodies the whole theory of Divine truth&mdash;"This is a
faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief" (1 Tim. i. 15).
When the two stranger ladies were walking up the passage, after the
close of the service, Mrs. Lewellin contrived to be standing with her
pew door partly open, but drew it back as they were in the act of
passing. The eye of the invalid lady caught hers; she paused, and
exclaimed with emotion&mdash;"And is it you, my dear Miss Roscoe?"</p>

<p>"Not Miss Roscoe <em>now</em>," replied Mrs. Lewellin, waving her hand
towards her husband; "I have exchanged it for Lewellin. And is
it you, my dear Miss Rawlins?"</p>

<p>"Yes, still Miss Rawlins, your old friend. How marvellous that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
we, who were once two such giddy girls, should meet after so great
a lapse of time in a Dissenting chapel!"</p>

<p>"The God of grace often works wonders."</p>

<p>"Always when he saves sinners."</p>

<p>"And does my dear Miss Rawlins feel herself to be a sinner?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and one of the chief. Some others may be more vile, but
no one can be more worthless."</p>

<p>"Is this an illusion, or a reality? Am I in some fairy land?"</p>

<p>"I do not wonder at your exclamation. It is more like romance
than reality."</p>

<p>They walked away from the chapel together, and when parting,
Mrs. Lewellin said, "If you are at the chapel in the evening we
will sit in the same pew."</p>

<p>"O yes, my dear; we greatly prefer the chapel to the church.
<em>There</em> we have the pomp of religion; <em>here</em> its beautiful simplicity.
At <em>church</em> we hear the Church itself and its ceremonial rites held
up to us from day to day; <em>here</em> the Saviour himself is placed before
us as the Alpha and Omega of the service. We are more partial
to the substance of the truth, than to shadowy forms."</p>

<p>In the evening a minister officiated, who was on a visit to Malvern
for the improvement of his health. He was a fine looking man,
though much emaciated, and preached as one whose eye was turned
away from the vanities of time, contemplating steadfastly the glories
of eternity. His text was strikingly appropriate to his own condition
and to ours:&mdash;"The fashion of this world passeth away"
(1 Cor. vii. 31).</p>

<p>"The context to this passage," said the minister, "tells us, my
brethren, what experience confirms&mdash;that our abode on earth is
short. St. Paul, therefore, exhorts us, and we will do well to attend
to his exhortations, to guard against too fond an attachment to any
relation or possession in life. You who weep, and you who rejoice,
should moderate the intensity of your emotions; as you will soon be
far removed from the influence of the causes which produce those
feelings, and the possessions which you now hold on the most secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
tenure will soon be claimed by others. Set not, therefore, your
heart on this world, which you must so soon leave. Its appearance
is attractive, like the shifting scenes of a theatre, or a gaudy pageant
in a public procession; but it will soon vanish from your sight, to
amuse and beguile others in like manner. There is another world&mdash;more
splendid, more glorious, and more durable&mdash;towards that you
should turn your attention, and seek with the most intense ardour
of soul to be prepared to enter it. Otherwise, when you depart from
this world&mdash;and you may very soon depart&mdash;you will go into outer
darkness, and be lost for ever."</p>

<p>"I hope, my dear Mrs. Lewellin," said Miss Rawlins, on the following
morning, when they were promenading by themselves in a
retired walk, "you will forgive me for not replying to the last letter
I received from you. Indeed, I have often reproached myself for
not doing it. It has been the occasion of bitter grief, and some tears,
especially of late."</p>

<p>"I can very easily forgive you, dear Miss Rawlins; but will you
permit me to ask you why you did not reply?"</p>

<p>"It was, at that period of my life, absolutely unintelligible. I
concluded you were become a mystic; and I foolishly imagined you
were contemplating taking the veil, and that I should soon hear
you had entered a convent. You will not be surprised at this when
you advert to the foolish letter I wrote to you about religion."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>"If agreeable to you," said Mrs. Lewellin, "I should like to hear
by what means you were brought to see and to feel your real character
and condition in relation to God and the eternal world."</p>

<p>"My history is a very singular one&mdash;abounding with incidents
that illustrate the workings of the special providence of God. You
know, my dear, in what a gay circle I moved. The concert, the
drama, the ball-room, card-parties, and novels absorbed my whole
soul. I lived in a perpetual whirl of excitement and gaiety. But
I was not happy, and often felt disgusted with my own frivolous
pursuits. At length, I had a severe and dangerous illness, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
on by imprudently exposing myself to the cold damp air, in returning
from a ball. For some weeks my life was despaired of, and
these were weeks of terror. I was brought to the verge of the dark
world, and felt appalled at the thought of entering it. I was rebellious,
too, and murmured against God for depriving me of life at
such an early period."</p>

<p>"It was by a cold, caught at a ball, that your old friend, Miss
Denham, lost her life."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>"Yes; I recollect you alluded to her death in a letter I received
from you. Were you intimate with her?"</p>

<p>"I was with her when she died."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I know she was a gay devotee to the world; and, therefore,
it may be painful to hear how she died. What myriads are
offered as victims to the Moloch of fashion!"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, not painful. Her head was reclining on the bosom
of a pious friend, who was present with me at the interview; and
her last words were&mdash;'I am dying, but not without hope of attaining
eternal life, through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.'"</p>

<p>"How thankful I am to hear that. It is like the rescue of a friend
from shipwreck. But to resume my story. I was gradually restored
to health, and re-entered the gay world, amidst the warm congratulations
of my friends. At the close of the season we came to Malvern
to spend a few months. Here the mystic roll of Providence
began to unfold itself. One day, when rambling by myself over the
common, I saw a neat little cottage, which I entered. It was occupied
by an old woman, who sat reading her Bible. I apologized for
my act of intrusion; when she requested me to take a seat.</p>

<p>"'I hope,' she added, looking at me benignantly as she spoke,
'you love your Bible. It tells us about Jesus Christ; about his
love for poor sinners; and about his dying for them, to save them
from perishing; and it tells us that if we come to him He will never
forsake us. There is no book like God's Book.'</p>

<p>"I felt confused, and soon left her; but her words followed me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
They were perpetually sounding in my ears; and yet I could not
draw out of them any intelligible meaning. A few days after this
I met an old school-fellow, looking very ill; and having promised to
call on her, I did so the following week. I found her confined to
her bed, and evidently with but a short time to live. She said to
me, when taking leave of her, 'You see, my dear Miss Rawlins,
that I am now going into another world: and I go in peace, because
I look by faith to Jesus Christ, who died to save sinners. He has
assured me, in the Bible, that if I come to him, and trust in him,
He will save me. You have been near death, but your life is spared;
let me entreat you to leave the gay and thoughtless crowd, and come
by faith to Jesus Christ to save you, and to make you happy.'</p>

<p>"These last words made a deep impression on my heart, and gave
rise to some painful reflections. Must I then, I said to myself, withdraw
from the gay world to be happy? Can Jesus Christ make me
happy? How is this possible, when he is dead, and gone to heaven?
These references to Jesus Christ reminded me of your letter,
which, as it happened still to be in my writing desk, I again perused.
I was struck with the harmony of sentiment and testimony
between your letter, the observations of the old woman, and the
appeal of my dying friend; and I felt its influence, even though it
appeared to me, in a great measure, unintelligible."</p>

<p>"It is said of Samson," remarked Mrs. Lewellin, "that the Spirit
of the Lord moved him at times; that is, he was occasionally acted
on by an unusual impulse. And something analogous to this may be
traced in our moral history; the recurrence of impressions and emotions,
of a singular character, proceeding from some unknown cause.
The Lord the Spirit is at work in the heart, but his operations are
veiled in darkness; happily, the time for explanation comes at last."</p>

<p>"It has been so, my dear Mrs. Lewellin, in my experience. Singular
events have been employed to produce those singular emotions;
but at the time, I could trace them to no perceptible cause, nor did
I ever suppose they would lead to any important issue. But the
mystery is now graciously explained. Soon after our return home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
another incident occurred, which exercised a material influence on
my mind. We went to dine with an old friend of my father's, who
lived about ten miles from town, and intended to return in the evening,
but such a violent storm came on, that we were glad to accept
our friend's invitation to remain for the night. At nine o'clock the
parlour bell was rung, and in a few minutes the servants entered,
and our own coachman with them, when a large Bible was placed
near a clergyman, one of the party. He read the second chapter of
St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, and offered up a very solemn
and impressive prayer. This was quite novel; I had never before
been present at such a service. I was again brought into contact
with the great facts of revelation; and when on my knees before
God in prayer, I became still more restless in my mind. I felt a
strong inclination to go again to scenes of gaiety, to dispel the
strange thoughts, and still stranger forebodings, which haunted me;
and yet I recoiled from doing so, under an instinctive apprehension
that they would make me still more restless and unhappy. I felt,
at times, so miserable, that I took no interest in life. At this crisis,
another incident occurred, trivial in itself, and apparently casual,
but it was one of those agencies which were working together for
my good. Our coachman brought with him, from the pious family
which we had been visiting, some religious tracts; and on passing
through the kitchen I saw one on the dresser; it was <cite>Poor Joseph</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
I took it and read it. It delighted me from its singularity. I involuntarily
exclaimed, when I had finished reading it, 'What a contrast
between this poor half-witted man and myself! he is in ecstasy
when referring to Jesus Christ coming into the world to save sinners,
but I can only refer to this great fact with apathy and indifference.
How is this?' It appeared strange, and was a heavy burden
on my heart."</p>

<p>"Our Lord says, 'They that be whole need not a physician, but
they that are sick' (Matt. ix. 12). A man in health looks with indifference
on the physician; but not so the dying patient. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
deep sense of personal guilt, and a vivid apprehension of positive
danger, that fits a sinner to form a correct estimate of the need and
value of a Saviour. When such a discovery is made and felt, then
it is hailed with rapture, and mental repose is enjoyed as the consequence
of trusting on the Saviour for pardon and salvation."</p>

<p>"I now perceive and feel this; but it would still have been hidden
from me, had it not been for another circumstance. I had one gay
friend to whom I was much attached; indeed, with the exception of
my parents, she was the only person I really loved. She completely
ruled me, though one of the most gentle creatures I ever knew. I
was never so happy as when in her company. She was as fond of
the gay world as myself. On one occasion we had both accepted an
invitation to a grand ball given by Sir John Markham, but in the
morning I received a note from my friend requesting me not to
expect to meet her there; adding, 'I withdraw from the gay world,
and for ever. It is a vain show, which promises happiness, but yields
none. Don't be alarmed; I will explain when I see you.' This note
took me by surprise; but I was more pleased than distressed. I
refrained from going to the ball, and went to see my friend. She
then informed me that her attention had recently been turned to
her Bible, by a sermon she heard preached by the Rev. James Harrington
Evans, and she had resolved to seek lasting happiness by
yielding herself to God, through the redemption of Christ Jesus the
Lord. Her conversation, though somewhat unintelligible to me, was
in perfect harmony with the sentiments I had previously heard
others express. I now readily complied with her earnest solicitation
to accompany her, on the following Sunday morning, to hear
the same eloquent preacher. We went together. His text was, 'For
through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father'
(Eph. ii. 18). When he was explaining to us the nature of access to
the Father, and showing us why and how we ought to come to Him,
the veil was removed, and the light of life shone with clear radiance
into my heart. I felt subdued, captivated; and, for the first time of
my life, I could say, 'Now I know where true happiness is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
found.' <em>Now</em> I could understand your letter. I followed, then,
without hesitation, my friend's example, in withdrawing from the
gay world."</p>

<p>"I suppose," here remarked Mrs. Lewellin, "the secession of two
such gay devotees from the circle of fashion, occasioned some little
tumult?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, we had a few calls from some of the more inquisitive,
who live on excitement; but we were both inflexible, and now we
are subjected to no annoyance."</p>

<p>"What did your parents say?"</p>

<p>"I think they were more pleased than otherwise, especially my
dear mother, whose health had been rapidly declining for some
months. Very soon afterwards she was confined to her room; and
God honoured me to be the instrument in directing her to the Lamb
of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. She passed through
a severe ordeal of mental suffering during her long illness; but when
descending into the dark valley, she saw, by faith, Jesus coming to
receive her; and she died in peace."</p>

<p>"These varied conflicts, my dear Miss Rawlins, in which you have
been engaged, must have proved a severe trial to you."</p>

<p>"They have rather seriously affected my health, which has given
way, and occasioned our present visit to Malvern."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on your rescue from the allurements of a
vain and giddy world. Now that you are made alive from the
dead, you must yield yourself to God, to fear, and love, and glorify
him, and show forth his praise."</p>

<p>"As I have now, my dear Mrs. Lewellin, unbosomed to you the
secrets of my heart, I shall feel more at ease. But, O! where can
I find words adequate to express my grateful feelings to my adorable
Saviour, for the marvellous manifestations of his sovereign
compassion and love to my dear mother, my beloved friend, and myself!"</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Lewellin went with Miss Rawlins, to see the
old woman who lived in the cottage on the common. On entering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
they found her in her arm chair, with her Bible open before her,
so intent on what she was reading, that she did not appear to notice
them, till she was spoken to.</p>

<p>"Sit down, ladies; I am glad to see you."</p>

<p>"At your old employment, I see," said Miss Rawlins.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss, I don't know that I can be at a better. It is proper
that a child should read his father's epistles of love, and that
a servant should study to know what his master requires him to do
and suffer."</p>

<p>"Do you ever feel weary of reading the parts of the Bible you
have read before?"</p>

<p>"It is, Miss, with God's Word, as it is with God's world. We
enjoy a serene evening and the beauties and melodies of the spring,
as much this year, as we did in any gone-by year of our life. I was
just thinking, before you ladies came in, that I could say nearly off
at heart the third chapter of John's Gospel; and yet I could read
it again, with as much pleasure and profit, if not more, than I did
the first time I read it. There is such a wonderful depth, and such
a rich fulness and living power in God's Word."</p>

<p>"What book," inquired Mrs. Lewellin, "do you like next to the
Bible?"</p>

<p>"O, dear, Ma'am, I have long done with all other books. I used to
like good John Bunyan's <cite>Pilgrim</cite>, and I have read it through many
times; but now I care about no book but my Bible. I sometimes
think I should like to take the Bible with me to heaven, as then I
should be able to have some dark sayings explained, which I can't
understand now."</p>

<p>"You have no doubts, I suppose, about the certainty of your
salvation?"</p>

<p>"No, Ma'am; not <em>now</em>. Some time since, I was greatly distressed
with doubts and fears, but now all my anxieties are at rest. I stand
with my staff in my hand, waiting to hear my Father call me
home. He will call soon."</p>

<p>"How simple, and how dignified," said Mrs. Lewellin, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
were leaving the cottage, "are the anticipations of an old disciple,
when approaching the entrance to the heavenly kingdom!"</p>

<p>"And what a contrast," replied Miss Rawlins, "to the devotees of
fashion! They will amuse themselves at the card-table, till their
hands become too enfeebled to play; and even on a death-bed will
listen with deep interest to descriptions of operas and plays, a new
singer, or a new actor; inquire with eager curiosity who wore the
most splendid dress at the ball&mdash;what new marriage is now on the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapis</i>&mdash;in short, will listen to anything, however trifling, to keep off
the thought of dying."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Lewellin; "and when, for form's sake, the officiating
priest is sent for, and he has gone through the prescribed ceremonies&mdash;has
read the absolution and given the sacrament, and they
have thus made their peace with God&mdash;they still live on, as long as
they can live, amidst the gay scenes of former times now gone from
them for ever. But to that one great event in their moral history,
which is so certain, and so near at hand, all references or allusions
are imperatively forbidden, as though its entire oblivion could prevent
its actual occurrence. O, it is painful to think of the terrific
surprise and overwhelming horror which will seize on their
spirits, when they pass into the eternal world!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; and if <em>our</em> preparations for death, and if our reminiscences
and anticipations when dying, should bear, as I trust
they will, a nearer resemblance to the dignified deportment, and the
sweet serenity of the old woman on the common, than to the criminal
frivolity of these self-doomed devotees of fashionable life, we
must, in imitation of the devout Psalmist, and with tears of joyous
gratitude, ever say&mdash;'Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto
thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake'&mdash;(Psalm
cxv. 1.)"</p>

<p>On their return from this visit, Mrs. Lewellin said, with some
embarrassment of manner, "We have now, my dear Miss Rawlins,
been at Malvern longer than we contemplated. We leave to-morrow,
but I hope that we may again meet somewhere on earth, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
renew the sweet and hallowed intercourse we have so much enjoyed
here."</p>

<p>"I am thankful that you kept the secret of your departure to the
last moment. An earlier intimation of the exact time would have
had on my heart a very depressing effect. Our conversations at
Malvern will ever be held by me in pleasing remembrance, and I
shall long for an opportunity to renew them. Good night. We
will have no formal parting. It will be too painful."</p>

<p>As Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin had exceeded the time which they had
originally contemplated spending on their tour, they now proceeded
homewards to Rockhill, where they found Mr. and Mrs. Roscoe, and
a few other friends, waiting to welcome them to their new home.
The meeting was a delightful one, nothing having occurred to either
party, during their absence, to occasion annoyance or perplexity.</p>

<p>A few months after their return, Mrs. Lewellin received the following
letter from Miss Rawlins:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Lewellin</span>,&mdash;It will give you, I have no doubt, some
pleasure to hear that I am again in my father's house, and in the
enjoyment of perfect health and vigour. And you will, I doubt not,
unite with me in humble adoration and gratitude to the God of all
grace, not only for the grace bestowed on me&mdash;one of the most
worthless of the unworthy&mdash;but for his marvellous loving-kindness
to my dear father, who is so much delighted, and so deeply moved
by the preaching of the Rev. J. H. Evans, that he attends his chapel
with me regularly every Sabbath. Though there is no decisive evidence
that he is become a new creature in Christ Jesus, yet I hope
he is entering the narrow way that leads to life. He spends much
of his time in reading his Bible and Doddridge's <cite>Exposition</cite>, and is
very earnest in his inquiries about coming to Christ to be saved.
Truly the God of grace often works wonders. My endeared friend,
Miss Forrester, whom you saw with me at Malvern, is now, and is
likely to continue to be for some time, an inmate in our family. We
were one in spirit when we were living and moving amidst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
frivolous and ensnaring gaieties of life; and we are still one in spirit
now we are both united to the Lord; but it is a spirit of a purer
nature, and one that death cannot destroy.</p>

<p>"I often think of our unlooked-for meeting at Malvern, and the
pleasant hours of Christian intercourse we spent together when
there. I hope both you and Mr. Lewellin have been enjoying good
health since your return home. I need not say how glad I shall be
to hear from you. Write soon, and believe me, ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Letitia</span>."

<h2>THE WANDERER'S RETURN.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_503.jpg" alt="S" width="100" height="105" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Some months having now elapsed since Mr. Lewellin's
marriage, I set off to pay my long promised visit to
my esteemed friend and his lady. I was accompanied
by Mrs. Orme, who joined me in London from the
Elms, and after a pleasant journey we arrived safely at Rockhill.
It was promptly decided that the first half of my time should be
spent with them, and the other at Fairmount, with Mr. and Mrs.
Stevens. The day after my arrival, I took a stroll round the
farm with Mr. Lewellin, and I was much gratified by its general appearance.
I did not see his bailiff, Harry Pickford, as he was gone
to Weyhill fair, to purchase a few South-down sheep; but I had
great pleasure in hearing that his master had every reason to be
satisfied with him, and that great confidence was placed in his judgment
and activity. "He is," Mrs. Lewellin facetiously remarked,
"an able professor in the science of agriculture; and I think, Sir, if
you examine Mr. Lewellin, you will pronounce him an apt scholar.
He has made much rapid progress in his studies during the session;&mdash;he
may possibly take a degree."</p>
</div>

<p>On the Sabbath it was arranged, while we were at breakfast, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
Mrs. Orme should ride to church with our kind host and hostess;
but I preferred walking, as I wished to take the same route I had
taken some years before, and ascertain, if possible, what practical
effect had resulted from my casual advice to Robert Curliffe, whom,
on a previous occasion, I had found working in his garden,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> with
his two sons. It was a fine autumn morning, without a cloud; the
air was genial and invigorating, and the stillness of the solitary
lane along which I was passing formed an agreeable contrast to the
noise and bustle of the thronged streets of my town residence. Robert's
cottage still stood where I first saw it, but its appearance was
greatly improved, and his garden was in a higher state of cultivation.
These were auspicious signs, and formed, as will shortly be
seen, fresh illustrations of an oft-repeated remark, that the work
of grace in the heart contributes to the promoting of temporal as
well as spiritual comfort. On entering his cottage, I found him
dressed in his Sunday clothes, with his Bible beside him on the
table, and in his hand Fuller's <cite>Gospel its own Witness</cite>. He expressed
great joy at seeing me; and his wife, offering me a chair,
said, "You will see a change here, Sir, since your first visit; the
grace of God is a wonder-working power."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you are both happier than when you preferred
working in the garden on the Sabbath to going to church?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said Robert, "we are; and we are better off in worldly
matters. Our home is a quieter home. Our lads are more orderly
in their manners, and both go to Mr. Ingleby's Sunday-school. We
are a reformed family."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like," said Robert's wife, "for things to go back into
their old state; it would be like a good garden going back to a
common waste."</p>

<p>"You have now something of more importance to think about
and talk about, than about planting and weeding your garden."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, the wonderful facts of the Bible; especially God's unspeakable
gift of a Saviour who is able and willing to save us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>"What the Lord has done for us in our souls, since you had the
first talk with our Robert, has given me a wonderful liking to the
Bible, and to Mr. Ingleby's preaching. Before that time, if I read
a bit of a chapter, I could not make out its meaning; and if I heard
a sermon, it made no impression on my heart; it came in at one ear,
and went out at t'other. Ah! dear; things are wonderfully changed
in us. I shouldn't like them to be changed back again; it would be
worse than seeing our garden overrun with thistles and nettles."</p>

<p>I now pressed on to church. The Curate read the Liturgy with
great solemnity and pathos. My Dissenting prejudices subsided as
I listened to the solemn words of prayer; and the responses had a
soul-inspiring effect. "Yes," I said to myself, "the prayers are
simple, sublime, and appropriate; they are such as a sinner should
offer up, when kneeling before the Lord; they prepare the heart to
unite with the voices of the heavenly kingdom in their chorus of
thanksgiving and praise." At length I saw the vestry door open;
the venerable Rector walked out, ascended the flight of stairs, and
entered his pulpit. After a short extempore prayer, he announced
his text&mdash;"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was
yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him" (Luke xv. 20).</p>

<p>On my previous visit to Fairmount, I had observed that the infirmities
of age were fast creeping upon Mr. Ingleby, and this was
now much more manifest, though it could scarcely be wondered at,
as the good Rector had considerably advanced beyond the period
generally allotted to the life of man, being now upwards of eighty
years of age. His voice, however, was still clear and sonorous;
and though there was less activity and brilliancy of imagination,
yet the same bold and impassioned appeals to the conscience and
the heart came from his lips as when I first heard him. He commanded
the attention of his audience, and he rewarded it. After
describing the old man walking anxiously up and down in the
cool of the evening in front of his rural mansion, situated, it might
be, in some remote quarter of Palestine, he proceeded to recount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
his supposed soliloquy, while thinking of his long-lost child:&mdash;"'Is
he still living, or has he been devoured by some wild beast of prey!
Is he in affluence, or is he in want! Does he ever think of his
home, and of his father, or has he forgotten both! Shall I ever
see him again! Shall I ever embrace him again, as I embraced him
the morning he left me! Shall I ever hear him address me 'father,'
as I was once accustomed to hear him call me!' The old man is
now just going to retire for the night, when something is seen
moving in the distance&mdash;it advances&mdash;it is a man&mdash;a poor forlorn
outcast, come to ask for shelter; he shall not be denied; he looks
more fixedly&mdash;the figure advances, yet it is still a great way off; it
is&mdash;no, it cannot be; he looks&mdash;it is, it is my son! See how the old
man runs to embrace the traveller! What a joyous meeting! what
a night of gladsome mirth and hallowed devotion! And who, beloved
brethren, supplies me with the materials for this dramatic
sketch? Jesus Christ. For what purpose? To assure us that our
heavenly Father feels more compassion for a relenting sinner than
he can feel sorrow for his sins; and that He feels more paternal delight
in the exercise of mercy, than a sinner can feel joy by having
all his sins forgiven him."</p>

<p>When the sermon was over, I saw Farmer Pickford and his wife
standing at the corner of the lane, waiting for my approach.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you back again. I have looked for this day,
many a day, and many a night, since you were preaching in the
barn. You look well, Sir. Time makes no change in your appearance."</p>

<p>"I hope, Sir," said Mrs. Pickford, "you will come and see us; we
shall be so much pleased."</p>

<p>"We have had, Farmer, a very touching sermon this morning."</p>

<p>"It touched me to the quick, and no mistake. I have shed more
tears this morning than I ever shed in any morning since I was
born. It made me feel a power of trouble, like."</p>

<p>"And it greatly affected me," said Mrs. Pickford; "it made me
think of our long lost George; shall we ever see him again?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>"He, my dear friend, who brought back the prodigal of the gospel,
can bring back your dear son."</p>

<p>"I hope he will," replied the Farmer. "I don't care in what condition
he comes home, so that he does come back, and I live long
enough to receive him. He may come in rags for what I care. I'll
give him a capital supper, and a new suit; and we'll have a joyous
merry-making, and no mistake. You'll give us another sarmunt
in the barn?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do, Sir," urged his wife; "we shall be so pleased, and profited,
too. One of our neighbours, Mr. Richards, was so impressed by
your discourse on the conversion of Zaccheus, that he is quite a
changed character. He was, before he heard it, a very irreligious
man; but now he regularly goes to church every Sabbath morning,
and to Mr. Stevens' chapel every Sabbath evening. And he comes
to our weekly prayer-meeting; and we often have edifying conversation
with him."</p>

<p>"Before he heard that sarmunt," said the Farmer, "Richards was
just what I was before your first talk to me about my soul&mdash;a
drunken, swearing sort of chap; but now he keeps as sober as a
judge; and his talk is quite heavenly. He gets on in the good
things faster than I do; I'm still but a dullish sort of a scollard;
worse luck. But after all, I know something about the one thing
needful; that's worth knowing. The Lord be praised; and many
thanks to you, Sir."</p>

<p>"I hope, Farmer, by this time, that you enjoy a well-grounded
assurance, that you are accepted in the Beloved, and feel safe for
eternity."</p>

<p>"As for that, Sir, I must speak with great care. I must not be
too bold. Howsomever, I don't fear dying, and that's a main good
thing; a kind of a triumph, like; the Lord be praised. I love Jesus
Christ&mdash;that's certain; I love my Bible, and I love the services of
God's house more than I used to love the ways of sin, and that is
saying a good deal. Will you give us another sarmunt in the barn,
Sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and I will let you know when I can do it."</p>

<p>I dined in the course of the following week at Mr. Roscoe's, and
much enjoyed my visit. It revived a recollection of the discussions
of former times, between him and his Tractarian brother, now become
an able advocate of the faith he then laboured to destroy. I
never saw Mr. Roscoe looking better; his spirits were buoyant,
rising at times to youthful cheerfulness. He abounded with anecdotes,
both grave and facetious; and was, indeed, the soul of the
social circle. We were deeply interested by the narration of an
occurrence which happened on the preceding day, and which I will
give in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I walked yesterday as far as Brushwood House, on a little matter
of business, and on my return home, just as I came to the corner of
the coppice, I saw a respectable looking young man sitting on the
stump of a tree in the hedgerow. He rose, bowed, and said, 'My
name, Sir, is George Pickford, and I am just back from a long roving
trip, on board of a merchant ship, and I have been watching a
long while for some one to go and tell father and mother that I am
back safe and sound. I am afraid to go home till some one has told
them that I am here, because, as they don't know whether I am
dead or alive, my abrupt appearance may startle them. And if,
Sir, you will be so kind as to do this little job for me, I shall feel a
power of gratitude. It won't take you far out of the way.' After
chatting awhile with him about the places he had visited, I asked
him whether he had been successful and taken care of his money,
'Why, Sir,' he replied, 'as I am so near home, I don't mind confessing
to you what I have confessed to no man since I came on shore.
I have saved upwards of Â£130; and I have it in a leather bag
belted round my body under my shirt. I kept clear of the land
sharks in every port we entered. I have for the last four years
kept within compass&mdash;never gaming on board, and never drinking
on shore; but before then I used to do such things.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pickford saw me approaching the farm-house. She was all
hurry and bustle to get herself, and her neat little parlour, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
for my reception. I took a chair and talked some time about things
in general, and then alluded to the sermon we had heard on Sabbath
morning. The tear fell from her eye, as she said to me, 'Sir, it was
a most painful sermon; it brought my George so forcibly before my
mind,'</p>

<p>"'You may possibly,' I remarked, 'see him again.'</p>

<p>"'I don't expect it, Sir. He has been gone six years come the 8th
of October; and we have not heard from him, or a word about him,
since he left us.'</p>

<p>"'Be of good cheer; you will see him ere long.'</p>

<p>"'Her look was now wild and penetrating; and she exclaimed,
'What, Sir, do you say, and shall I see my George ere long?'</p>

<p>"'Be composed,' I added, 'I bring you glad tidings. Your George
is back safe and sound; and he has requested me to come and tell
you.'</p>

<p>"'Back, Sir! safe and sound; and you have seen him; tell me,'
rising as she spoke, 'where he is, that I may see him too.'</p>

<p>"I then said, 'If you will sit down, and promise to remain seated
for the next quarter of an hour, you shall see him.'</p>

<p>"'A hard promise, Sir; but I thank the Lord he has given me an
opportunity to make it.'</p>

<p>"I stepped through the fold-yard, hailed George, who was on the
watch, and then led him to his mother. I shall not attempt a description
of the scene that followed. She sprang into his arms, and
he into hers.</p>

<p>"'Mother, forgive me.'</p>

<p>"'I do, my child.'</p>

<p>"'I have sinned against Heaven and in thy sight, my mother.'</p>

<p>"'I forgive all, my dear, dear George; and bless the Lord for
giving me this opportunity of telling you so.'</p>

<p>"His younger brother and his sisters, who stood gazing and weeping,
all gathered around him, as soon as his mother withdrew her
embraces. 'But where is father?' I heard him say, as I retired from
this scene of domestic joy and happiness.</p>

THE WANDERER'S RETURN.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>"One thing I must not forget to mention. When it came up in the
course of our conversation, at our first interview, that I knew his
old master, his robbery of whom occasioned his running away, he
put a letter into my hand, and asked me if I would deliver it to
him. It contained the amount stolen, with interest, and compound
interest up to the present date: with a confession of his crime, and
an entreaty for forgiveness."</p>

<p>We were all deeply affected by this touching tale, particularly
Mrs. Lewellin and Mrs. Orme, who said, both speaking at the same
time, "We must go and see George and his mother, and congratulate
them on their happy meeting."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the midst of life, we are in death. We had a most unexpected
confirmation of this during my stay at Fairmount. Mr. Stevens
had engaged to accompany Mr. Roscoe to Norton, on a trifling matter
of business; and as they were to start at ten o'clock, Mr. Roscoe
rose rather early, took breakfast with Mrs. Roscoe, conducted family
prayer as usual, and then retired into his study. Mr. Stevens came,
and as Mr. Roscoe did not make his appearance, Mrs. Roscoe rang
the bell, and desired the servant to call him. The servant went to
his room, knocked several times, but receiving no answer she opened
the door, and saw her master in the attitude of prayer. This circumstance
induced her quietly to retire, but on closing the door,
she was so much struck with the singular position in which she had
seen his head, that she returned towards him, and immediately exclaimed
in consternation, "My master is dead!" This exclamation,
which was heard by Mr. Stevens, induced him to run up stairs,
where he found the servant standing, petrified by terror, near her
venerable master, who had, when engaged in the holy exercise of
communion with God his Saviour, left the scene of his earthly cares
and bliss, to take possession of his heavenly inheritance. His hands
were yet warm, and his countenance had undergone no change, but
the eyelids and the mouth had fallen&mdash;there was no respiration, no
motion, for he had ceased to be a citizen of earth. The consternation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
which this unexpected event occasioned cannot be described. It
burst upon the family like a thunder-storm. Mrs. Roscoe hastened
into the study. "My husband, my dear husband!" she exclaimed,
and was carried fainting into an adjoining room, where she remained
for a quarter of an hour in a state of total insensibility, unconscious
of her loss, till she saw Mr. Stevens approaching her.</p>

<p>"And is my husband dead, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Be composed, my dear friend, it is the Lord's doing."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, I know it; but it is still a terrible trial. Does Sophia
know it? Oh! tell her to come to me immediately."</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens hastened to convey the mournful tidings to Mr. and
Mrs. Lewellin. When he rode up the lawn in front of their house
he saw them returning from a morning's walk, and after an exchange
of a few common-place inquiries, he took Mr. Lewellin aside,
and communicated the intelligence. Mrs. Lewellin, on looking
through the parlour window saw that Mr. Stevens was the bearer
of some news that deeply affected her husband; and feeling apprehensive
that it bore some reference to her parents, she immediately
rushed out, and asked if all was well.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," said her husband, "all is well that the Lord
does."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it; but what has he done?"</p>

<p>"Your father"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father! What! tell me!"</p>

<p>"Your father," said Mr. Stevens, "was taken suddenly ill this
morning, and when I left him was not able to speak to me."</p>

<p>"Is he living, Sir? O, tell me! Suspense tortures me! Let me
know the full extent of the calamity!"</p>

<p>"Your father is now mingling his praises with the redeemed
before the throne!"</p>

<p>"What! and have I lost my father? Is he gone without giving
me his blessing? How did he die?"</p>

<p>"We found him dead on his knees in the study."</p>

<p>"On his knees! O, happy saint!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>"His death has indeed been a translation."</p>

<p>"And how does my dear mother sustain the blow?"</p>

<p>"She wishes to see you immediately."</p>

<p>They hastened to the house of mourning, but on entering the
breakfast-parlour in which Mr. Roscoe had only a few hours before
partaken of his last meal on earth, Mrs. Lewellin's feelings overcame
her. On recovering from this hysteric fit she became more composed,
and expressed a desire to see her afflicted mother, and being
supported by Mr. Lewellin and Mr. Stevens, she was led into the
room where the bereaved widow sat, silent and motionless, in all
the solitude and agony of grief. She rose to meet her daughter, and
in a moment they were closely locked in each other's embrace, but
they were too much overpowered with anguish to utter any words
but those of sorrow. They wept aloud, but in their weeping there
was the majesty of grief, bending in unmurmuring submission to the
will of their heavenly Father.</p>

<p>"And is my father dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, you have lost your father, and I have lost my
husband."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewellin looked round the room, and having fixed her eye on
his full-length picture, she approached it, and said, "There he is!
yes, there he is! My father! speak, my father! It is thy Sophia
that speaks to thee!" She stood silent for a few moments, and then
sunk in the arms of her husband. For several hours she continued
in a state of high delirium, but became gradually composed, and
retired to rest. Next morning she awoke with her feelings less agitated;
and though she wept when she saw her mother, yet she spoke
of their mutual loss with more tranquillity.</p>

<p>"Though it has pleased God," said the bereaved widow, "to deprive
us of the visible presence of one we so ardently loved, we must
not abandon ourselves to unavailing grief&mdash;we must not sorrow as
others that have no hope; but rather bow down our souls in submission
to his holy will and say, 'Even so, O righteous Father, for so
it hath seemed good in thy sight.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope, my dear mother, I can repeat that sentiment; but still I
feel that I have lost one of the best of fathers that ever called a child
his own; and if I should be unable to control my feelings, I hope
you will bear with me. Ours is no common loss."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To relieve myself in some measure from the depression which this
bereavement had occasioned, I bent my footsteps towards Farmer
Pickford's homestead, and there I saw his son George, and had from
him a rough outline of his adventures, which I will briefly narrate.</p>

<p>He left the port of London, on board a merchant vessel, in company
with Jack Summers, who had seduced him into the ways of
iniquity; but poor Jack fell overboard, and was drowned, before he
set sail. His first voyage was to Havana; where, one day, he went
on shore with the ship's carpenter. They visited the slave-market,
where they saw men, women, and children sold like beasts of burden.
This sickened them, both of the West Indies and slavery;
but he said, "We served them out," for, on stepping into their boat
they found, coiled up in the jib-sail, a negro lad, about the age of
fifteen, who said, "Me let go wid you." They contrived to get him
on board without his being seen; George took off the top of an
empty water butt, put the negro in, gave him a bottle of water
and some bread and cheese, and told him to lie still till the ship was
under weigh. Early the next morning the negro's master came to
inquire if there was a black boy on board; and when the captain,
who didn't know anything about it, assured him that there was not,
he turned back; and soon after the vessel set sail. "We brought
him away with us," said George, "and he has been with me ever
since, and he is one of the best fellows of the crew for work." This
voyage, upon the whole, was a very pleasant one, and he took a
strong liking to a seafaring life. His second voyage was to Madeira,
and this, also, was a pleasant one, notwithstanding a short though
violent storm, which, to quote his own expression, "the little snug
vessel outrode in gallant style." His third voyage was to Calcutta;
but, on rounding the Cape, they encountered a tremendous hurricane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
which lasted several days and nights without intermission;
fears were entertained for the safety of the vessel, as she got fearfully
strained; and now it was that the captain discovered the
superior capabilities of George, for, having been apprenticed to a
carpenter, he was able to take the berth of the ship's carpenter, who
died some weeks before. On his return to port, the mate was promoted
to the captain's berth, who took the command of another
ship; and George Pickford took the berth of the mate. His character
for sobriety and activity gave much satisfaction to Messrs. B.,
his employers; and he was a great favourite with the crew. Nothing
occurred of any great importance for the next three years, till his last
visit to Calcutta, when the ship was detained for upwards of two
months; the captain giving him permission to go ashore as often as
he pleased. Here he met a young man whom he knew&mdash;a native of
Broadhurst, but now a resident in Calcutta&mdash;a decidedly pious man,
who invited him to spend the following Sabbath with him. He did
so; and they went together to the chapel in which Mr. James Hill,
an English missionary, preached. As he sat directly opposite the
pulpit, the eye of the preacher fell directly upon him&mdash;at least he
thought so; and the text, "Be sure your sin will find you out,"
(Num. xxxii. 23), brought his sin of dishonesty to his master, undutifulness
to his parents, and his uniform forgetfulness of God,
and contempt for his authority, with such vividness to his recollection
that he hastened on board as rapidly as possible. There, in
the quietude of his own berth, he pondered over this new discovery,
which was accompanied by a train of novel and poignant
emotions. His soul was overwhelmed with grief; but yet it was
a grief which gave him more relief than pain. It was pungent,
but it did not drive him to despair. Mr. Hill, in the conclusion of
his discourse, quoted the words of Jesus Christ&mdash;"Whosoever believeth
in him should not perish." "I caught hold of that promise," he
said, "and I kept hold of it; and I found it a rope strong enough to
save me. I believed I should not perish; I tried to pray, but could
not get further than the prayer of the publican, 'God, be merciful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
to me a sinner.'" He stated that he longed for the return of Sabbath
during the whole of the week; and when it came, though his duties
on board required his attention in the morning, yet in the evening
he was at liberty, and he again heard the same minister preach the
glorious gospel of the blessed God. He felt its great moral power
on his heart, reducing the wild tumult of feeling to a peaceful calm,
and giving him a good hope, through grace, of pardon and salvation.
The next morning the ship weighed anchor, and set sail; and he
closed his statement to me as follows:&mdash;"I left my home a wild
lad, and a criminal; I lived in bold rebellion against God up to the
age of twenty-three; I acted a most unkind and undutiful part
towards my dear parents, by keeping them in a state of ignorance
of my whereabouts. When I went into Mr. Hill's chapel I had no
more desire for conversion than I have now to be unconverted; but
the Lord had compassion on me, and has saved me: glory be to his
holy name. I am a brand plucked from the burning, if ever there
was one plucked; now I wish to live to show my gratitude to the
Lord Jesus Christ, for saving me; and to do good to my fellow-sailors.
I am glad to say that two of our crew are God-fearing men;
and we often meet together for reading the Bible and prayer. I
had many precious moments, in prayer to the Lord, on our voyage
back; and sometimes felt his presence near me, especially one night
in a fearful storm. I knew he had the winds and the waves under
his command. I trusted in him, and felt secure.</p>

<p>On my return to Fairmount, after this interview with George, I
met the Farmer, who gave me his usual hearty shake of the hand.</p>

<p>"Have you been to my homestead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and have seen your son George, and had a long chat with
him."</p>

<p>"He is grown a finish sort of a chap. He's more of the gemman
than his father, and no mistake. He has seen a main bit of the
world, like. How well he talks; and what a power of matter he has
to say. He keeps us up rather latish with his stories. Some are
funny and make us laugh; and some are shocking. Man is a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
fellow everywhere till the grace of God touches his heart. Howsomever,
George has scraped up a goodish bit of money. Ay, if a
man has any luck at sea, he often gets on faster than we do here on
land."</p>

<p>"Your son, I rather think, has found something more valuable
than gold, or silver, or precious stones."</p>

<p>"The Lord be praised. Yes, he has found the precious pearl of
great price. That's a proof to my mind that Jesus Christ is everywhere,
or my George would not have found him in Calcutta, which,
he says, is thousands of miles off. I suppose he has told you about
the sarmunt that made him feel all at once that he was in a new
world? He must have been as much surprised, when going out
of the chapel as Zaccheus was when he dropped down out of the
sycamore tree. What a wonder-working power the grace of God is,
and no mistake!"</p>

<p>"You were not at home, I believe, when your son arrived?"</p>

<p>"No, I had been all the morning, along with two of my men,
doing a bit of hedging and ditching in one of my lower meadows,
t'other side of the hill. And all the while I was working, I was
thinking over the sarmunt Mr. Ingleby preached on Sunday morning.
It was one of great power; it touched me to the quick, like.
And just as I was coming down the hill, to get a bit of dinner, I
saw a chap running across the fold-yard into the house. I wondered
who it could be. After a bit, he came out, and my mistress
with him, and I saw her pointing towards me. I felt all at once
a power of strange thoughts rush into me; and I stood still as the
chap was running towards me, jumping over hedge and ditch, like
a greyhound after a hare. When he got a bit nearer, about five
hundred yards off, I thought all at once it was the step and swing
of George; and I heard him cry out, 'Father! father!' as loud as he
could bawl; but for the life of me I couldn't speak a word more,
and I couldn't have been more frightened if I had seen two ghosts.
I seemed stuck fast into the ground with my tongue tied; so that I
was obliged to leave him to do all the work of hugging, and kissing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
and such like. When I got a bit over my fright, I told him I was
main glad to see him back; and that I would give him as good a
supper as was put on the table the night you gave us the sarmunt in
the barn about the conversion of Zaccheus."</p>

<p>"It must have been a joyous meeting to you."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking two or three times since, that it is almost
worth while to lose a youngster for a year or two, for the delight of
seeing him come back safe and sound. You should hear him read
the Bible and pray. It would do your heart good, Sir. Now, Sir,
when will you come and give us the sarmunt in the barn? George
shall read out the hymn, and pitch the tune, and then you will have
a sample of his cleverness in such matters. Old William, the shepherd,
says he'll take the biggest wether-bell he can find, and he'll
go round to all the cottages and farm-houses in those parts, and cry
notice of it. I must clear out both barns to find room for the people;
they'll come as thick as rooks after the plough. The Lord be
praised that I should ever live to see such joyous times and such
wonderful doings: no sham work; and I must not forget to thank
you for the part you have had in them."</p>

<p>"You may expect me next Wednesday week."</p>

<p>"Very well, Sir, I shall expect you on that day."</p>

<p>"But one thing I have to request, and that is, that you don't get
such a splendid supper as you did last time."</p>

<p>"I never trouble myself about kitchen matters. I leave that to
my wife, whose name is Martha; and you know that the Bible tells
us that Martha always has a liking to give a good treatment to our
best friends. No, no, I mustn't speak about such a matter; if I do,
there will be a rookery in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"Then I must send her a note and make the request myself."</p>

<p>"Well, just as you like, Sir; but I guess it won't matter. Women,
you know, don't like to be put out of their way; and I am
sure of one thing, that if you give us a good sarmunt, as you are
sure to do if you preach, she will give you a good supper, which she
is sure to do if she does the cookery. Why, Paul says, if you mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
Sir, that we must give our carnal things to them that give us spiritual
things."</p>

<p>As I was taking my leave of him, he said&mdash;"Please, Sir, just stop
one minute. It almost got out of my head; but it's back again.
Did George tell you what he says to his mother and me? He says
he is mate of this ship, which I suppose is a goodish sort of a thing;
and he says he thinks he shall be made a captain after he has had
another voyage or two, which I suppose is something better; and
he says he'll take his brother Sam with him and show him Calcutta
and &mdash;&mdash;, I forget what he calls it, but it is where our tea
comes from; and he says he'll make him a bonny sailor, which he
says is better than ploughing or turnip sowing. But his mother
don't like this talk, for she says she shall never sleep at night when
the wind gets up and the lightning comes. Well, I would rather
keep them both at home, than let either of them go; but George
has a desperate liking for the sea: and it seems to be his calling,
and we must trust the Lord to take care of them. O dear, how I
forget things! My thinkings about George coming back to us and
Sam going from us, drives almost everything out of my head. I
heard Bob Curliffe say, as I was crossing the lane on the top of the
hill, that he heard his master say to Mr. Hyde that Mr. Roscoe is
dead, is that true, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he died suddenly, yesterday morning, when on his knees in
prayer."</p>

<p>"That's just how I should like to die, and no mistake. What a
wonderful change for a man&mdash;all in a moment; from earth to heaven
in no time! Mr. Ingleby will give us a grand sarmunt on Sunday on
this subject, or I am no prophet. I shouldn't wonder if he takes the
matter of Enoch's getting into heaven without dying. I should like
that way of going, but we must leave all to the Lord. After all, I
don't care how I go, or who sees me go, so as I get into heaven
at last."</p>

<p>The Farmer was right in his predictions. Mr. Ingleby did give
us an excellent sermon on the translation of Enoch; and this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
followed by an admirable sketch of the character of our deceased
friend. But I can do no more than transcribe the subjoined paragraph,
which I took down at the time I heard it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When it pleaseth God to visit our friends with a lengthened
indisposition before he removes them, we have the pleasure of administering
to them the consolations of religion&mdash;of exchanging the
expressions of Christian sympathy&mdash;and catching from their lips
some sublime expressions of anticipated bliss. The sufferings, however,
which they generally endure are so keen and so poignant, that
in many instances we are thankful when the contest is over. But
if death comes in an unexpected hour, and bears off a friend without
giving us any warning, we are plunged into the lowest abyss of sorrow,
because we are denied the privilege of bidding him adieu: yet
as a mitigation of our anguish we have this consolation, that he was
not called to <em>walk</em> through the dreary valley, being borne as 'on angels'
wings' to heaven. In such a case his departure partakes more
of a translation than an act of dying; he oversteps the grave, and
enters into the possession of his purchased inheritance without having
his fears awakened by the solemnity of his removal, or his peace
disturbed by the anxieties and distress which it occasions to others.
One hour he is with his friends on earth, busily employed in all
the duties of his station&mdash;the next with his friends in the celestial
world, joining with them in their ascriptions of praise to Him that
sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb. One hour he is mourning
here below over the imperfections of his character&mdash;the next he feels
himself made perfect in purity and in blessedness; and while those
who revered and loved him are weeping around his breathless
corpse, he is taking his part in the exercises of that sacred temple
in which the worshippers serve the Lord day and night for ever."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At last the long expected Wednesday night came, and Mr. Stevens
drove me in his gig to Farmer Pickford's, where I found the barn
full of people waiting my arrival. His son George commenced the
service by reading a hymn, and he read it very well; he then led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
off the singing; his brother Harry, a good tenor, standing on his left,
and his father, a good bass, on his right. His mother, with two or
three younger females, stood behind, and altogether a very effective
rustic choir was formed. I selected for my text the 23d verse of the
11th chapter of the Acts&mdash;"Who, when he came, and had seen the
grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of
heart they would cleave unto the Lord."</p>

<p>"This, my dear brethren," I observed, "is very likely the last time
I may ever meet you, and address you, in this rustic temple, which is
as glorious in the eyes of the Holy One of Israel, as the magnificent
temple at Jerusalem, which was his local dwelling-place in ancient
times. For here he has condescended to visit you, though unseen,
and listen to your prayers and your praises; and here the glorious
gospel of his grace has proved his power to your salvation. Yes,
when you have finished your course, and the conflict is over, and
when you have gained the prize of your high calling, your recollections
will hover over this hallowed spot, as the spiritual birth-place
of your immortal souls; where you were quickened into newness of
life; and where 'after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that
holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until
the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his
glory' (Eph. i. 13, 14). I solemnly charge every one of you to be
faithful unto death, otherwise you will die in your sins, and be lost
for ever. And how dreadful would such a loss be!"</p>

<p>The service closed in the usual way, and the congregation dispersed.
The Farmer introduced several persons to me, who had
received spiritual benefit from the sermon on the conversion of
Zaccheus, particularly his neighbour Farmer Richards, of whose
conversion he had previously given me some account, and who
was invited to sup with us. This meal was as sumptuous as the
former one. It was soon over; and then before I rose from the
table I thus addressed them:&mdash;"Great spiritual changes, my dear
friends, have taken place in your family since I took my first meal
in this kitchen. You," addressing Mr. P., "were then an unenlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
and an unrenewed man, living without God in the world,
without Christ, and without hope; but now, with your dear wife,
you have passed from death unto life; have both tasted that the
Lord is gracious; are made fellow-heirs of the grace of life; and
can rejoice in the hope of your final salvation. Your first-born
has long since yielded himself to God, as one alive from the dead;
and there sits by your side your long-lost George, unexpectedly
restored to you, and made a new creature in Christ Jesus before
he came back to receive your parental benediction. And though
the younger children are not yet brought within the bonds of the
covenant"&mdash;(I was here interrupted by the Farmer, who, under an
excitement he could not repress, exclaimed, "I think our Sam is,
for I saw him on his knees in prayer the other night.")&mdash;"I am
glad to hear this, and I trust that he, like his two brothers, will
yield himself to God, to be renewed, sanctified, and saved; and
that his dear sisters will follow their example; and that all of you
will be saved, and glorified in the celestial world." "The Lord
grant it may be so," said all. At the urgent request of Mrs. Pickford,
I read a psalm, and prayed with the family. It was a solemn
service&mdash;more solemn than any preceding one, because it was the
last. Many wept when on their knees, and some wept when they
rose up, to give and receive the final farewell. I hastily shook
hands with every one in the room, simply saying, as I went out,
"Lord bless you, and keep you. I hope we shall meet in heaven."
"Amen!" was the response, given with an earnestness and a solemnity
that was almost overpowering.</p>

<p>When the Farmer came to button the apron of our gig, he again
took my hand; and he said, as the tear fell from his eye, "The
Lord be praised for sending you to taste my ale and cream cheese,
and you be thanked for coming. I hope you will pray for me, that
I may stick close to the Lord, with all my heart and soul; and I
hope you will always pray for our George and his brother Sam,
when the wind gets up. Good night, gemmen; a safe ride to Fairmount.
Farewell."</p>

<h2>A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_524.jpg" alt="O" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">One morning, while at breakfast at Fairmount, I was
surprised by a note from Mr. John Ryder, requesting
the favour of a call from me, at Aston, before I returned
home. The reader will remember Mr. Ryder<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
as a suitor of Miss Denham, and the affecting farewell of the latter
to him on her death-bed.</p>
</div>

<p>"There is a mystery in this," said Mr. Stevens, "which I cannot
account for. I have not seen Mr. Ryder for many months. Miss
Denham's death was a dreadful blow to him, and since then he has
never recovered his wonted spirits, but become quite a recluse,
neither paying nor receiving any visits."</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" I remarked; "her death may issue in his spiritual
life. I will send a reply, saying that I will call on him to-morrow
evening."</p>

<p>"He is a noble character," said Mrs. Stevens; "and a young man
of great intelligence and most amiable disposition. I trust his affliction
has led him to direct his attention to the only true source of
consolation. Indeed, I have some grounds for hoping that this is
the case, as I understand he has been very regular in his attendance
at church for some time past."</p>

<p>On going to Aston the following evening to call on Mr. Ryder, I
unexpectedly met him, and we walked together to his house. After
thanking me for my promptness in thus responding to his request,
he proceeded to disclose to me, without much reserve, the deep perplexity
and strongly excited state of his mind on the question of
personal religion; asking me, at the same time, for my advice, and
how he should act to obtain relief from his perplexities and depression
of spirit.</p>

<p>He frankly confessed that prior to the death of Miss Denham, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
whom he had long cherished a most ardent attachment, he had imbibed
some vague sceptical opinions against religion. Her dying
farewell, however, both astonished and confounded him, particularly
the last words which she addressed to him:&mdash;"We now part, but I
hope not for ever. Death, which is now removing me, may soon
call for you; and then I hope you will find that consolation in the
death of a despised Saviour, which it has pleased God, very unexpectedly
and undeservedly, to give to me." "I never," he remarked,
"heard her say anything like this before. She was now entering the
dark unknown world; but it appears that she derived consolation
from the death of Jesus Christ. How is this? said I, as I withdrew
from the chamber of death; and how can it be? I have said thousands
of times since. However, what I saw and heard on that
awfully appalling occasion left an indelible conviction on my mind,
that there is a something in religion suited to humanity at the most
momentous period of its history. But what is that something? I
said to myself. Is it a hidden mystery which the great teacher death
alone can explain; or is it possible to get the mystery explained before
death comes? This is the emphatic question I wish you to
solve, as my happiness both in this world and the next depends on
its solution."</p>

<p>In token of his sincerity, he told me that he had altogether withdrawn
from the gay world; regularly attended his parish church,
and had taken the sacrament several times. He now read the Bible,
and other devotional books, in preference to novels and periodicals;
and went through a regular form of private prayer, both morning
and evening. He closed by saying:&mdash;"But, like a man surrounded
by a thick mist when crossing some wild moor, I know not whether
I am going right or wrong&mdash;I can obtain no satisfaction."</p>

<p>I was about to reply to this communication, when our arrival at
Aston, and the appearance of Miss Ryder, to whom I was introduced
by her brother, put a stop to further conversation on the subject for
the present. We now entered the house, and while tea was preparing,
Mr. Ryder proposed that we should take a turn round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
garden. In passing along, my eye caught sight of a beautiful figure
of Ceres, resting on a pedestal. I remarked, that it was by a very
slow and painstaking process that things of real excellence were
brought to perfection.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Ryder; "a few months ago that beautiful
figure was a rough, shapeless stone. I have often thought, when
standing and admiring it, what an eye and what a taste its sculptor
must possess! But after all, it wants life to give the full expression
of beauty."</p>

<p>"It stands as an emblematical figure."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir; of the productive power of nature."</p>

<p>"And, Sir, of something else."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of the man who has the form of godliness, but who has never
felt its regenerating and life-giving power."</p>

<p>He paused, looked grave, but spoke not. After the lapse of a few
moments he moved on in silence, as though my words had excited a
new train of thought in his mind. At length he said:&mdash;"I do not
clearly understand what you mean by the expression&mdash;the regenerating
and life&mdash;giving power of godliness."</p>

<p>"I mean the regenerating power of the Divine Spirit, creating
anew the human soul, and infusing into it spiritual life. 'You,'
says the apostle, when addressing the members of the church at
Ephesus, 'hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins'
(Eph. ii. 1)."</p>

<p>"But is man, at any period of his moral history, living in a state
of death? Such a supposition appears to me to be paradoxical."</p>

<p>"Before the regenerating power of the Divine Spirit acts on the
soul of man, he lives in a state of death, in two senses. We say, for
example, of the culprit who is condemned to die, that he is a dead
man. His life is not his own; it is forfeited to the claims of justice.
And thus, while living in an unrenewed and unpardoned state, we
are legally dead; our life is forfeited to the claims of Divine justice;
and we are exposed to the penalty of the violated law of God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is that penalty?"</p>

<p>"Condemnation, including in its infliction the forfeiture of the
favour of God; mental disquietude, remorse, and dread of death,
exclusion from a state of happiness, on passing into the eternal world;
and banishment to hell, in despair, for ever. For it is written&mdash;'Cursed
is every one that continueth not in all things which are
written in the book of the law to do them' (Gal. iii. 10)."</p>

<p>He again moved on in silence; and then suddenly stopping, and
resting his eye for a few moments on the ground, he replied, under
great excitement:&mdash;"This, Sir, is a fearful condition of existence. It
is appalling. It chills my blood to think of it. Then my present
restlessness and disquietude of soul are the lighter inflictions of
this tremendous penalty&mdash;the premonitions of the coming storm of
God's righteous displeasure."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir; and they are given in mercy and in love."</p>

<p>"You surprise me. What! does mercy ever employ such terrific
forerunners to announce her coming? If so, for what purpose?"</p>

<p>"To rouse man, while living in a state of false security, to an
apprehension of his guilt, and consequent danger. They are, in fact,
warning voices, warning man to flee from the wrath to come, to
repent of his sins, and to make him feel the absolute necessity of
a Divine interposition to rescue him from the peril of his condition,
that he may 'seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon
him while he is near' (Isa. lv. 6)."</p>

<p>We now entered a tastefully constructed grotto, covered with ivy,
situated at the upper extremity of the garden. Here we had an
enchanting prospect of the surrounding country, and stood gazing
on it for a while in silence, when Mr. Ryder remarked&mdash;"This, Sir,
is a beautiful world."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," I replied; "and it would have been a happy world, if
sin had not entered and defiled it, and thus marred our happiness.
The beasts of the field and the birds of the air appear to have
escaped its withering influence. They are happy. It is only man,
the noblest specimen of the Divine workmanship, who is groaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
and pining away in mournful sadness, under its polluting and destroying
power."</p>

<p>"To me, Sir, it appears surprising that the Deity should have permitted
sin to enter this province of his vast dominions, and allow
it to become the active agent of so much crime and misery, when he
could so easily have prevented it, if he had chosen."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised by your remarks, for unquestionably the dispensation
under which we are living is awfully mysterious; but still,
notwithstanding the impenetrable darkness which envelopes certain
parts of the Divine procedure, other parts are plain and intelligible,
obviously conducive to our present and final happiness. Hence, if
we act wisely, we shall turn our attention from what we <em>cannot</em>
know, to what we <em>may</em> know-from concealed reasons and causes,
to revealed facts. Instead, then, of perplexing ourselves about the
origin of evil, we shall sit at the feet of Jesus, and he will tell us
what God has done to repair the injury of the fall&mdash;'For God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life' (John
iii. 16). This, Sir, is plain, and this is intelligible; and we are
assured by the Son of God himself, that if we believe in him we
shall not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>

<p>"Your remarks, Sir, interest me. They illumine the darkness in
which my own thoughts have been long revolving in shapeless con
fusion. I begin to perceive that my salvation is possible. You
referred just now to another sense in which man is dead, in addition
to the forfeiture of his life, by his violations of the law of God;
will you explain what that other state of death is?"</p>

<p>Our conversation was here interrupted by a summons to tea. Mr.
Ryder was now profoundly silent on the questions which had engrossed
our attention, leaving an impression on my mind that his
sister had no sympathy with his spiritual anxieties and depression.
She was about twenty-five years of age, of very pleasing manners,
and an apparently amiable disposition&mdash;neither obtrusive nor reserved;
sprightly, and somewhat of a facetious turn. When looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
at and listening to her, the words which our Lord addressed to
the accomplished young ruler of Judea involuntarily occurred to me&mdash;"One
thing thou lackest." Her brother now proposed another
stroll in the garden, which was prevented by the arrival of some
visitors, and the rest of the evening passed away without any recurrence
to our former topic of conversation. On taking leave, Mr.
Ryder made me promise that I would soon repeat my visit, which I
accordingly did in the course of the ensuing week.</p>

<p>On this occasion I again met Mr. Ryder, as before, taking an
evening stroll, and we walked to Aston together. On passing an
old dilapidated mansion, we saw its proprietor standing in the porch,
a nondescript both in appearance and character. "That, Sir," said
Mr. Ryder, "is the most singular man I ever knew; he is very
wealthy, and leads a very selfish and sensual life; he loves nothing
but himself, his dogs, and his gun. He has sympathy for a dog
when in pain, but none for a human being. His dogs are fed sumptuously,
and taken the greatest care of, but he has never been
known to give anything in charity to his own species. He shuns all
intercourse with his fellow-men, and is, in fact, a perfect misanthrope&mdash;a
being without a heart. Not long ago, his father, who
lives in extreme poverty in the adjoining county, came to see him,
but he peremptorily ordered him away without giving him bit or
drop."</p>

<p>"This man," I replied, "loving nothing but himself, his dog, and
his gun, not even his own father, is happily a very rare case, but it
is one which is both illustrative and suggestive. He is a living emblem
of the unregenerate man; who is a selfish being, loving nothing
but what ministers to his own sensual gratifications. He has no
heart to revere and love his heavenly Father, and is consequently
unfit for heaven, and unfit to live amongst, and associate with the
pure and happy spirits who dwell there. If he were taken to heaven
in his present moral and spiritual condition, he would appear as
strange a being amongst them, as this man does amongst you&mdash;shunning
all, for want of congeniality of taste and disposition; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
shunned by all as odious and repulsive; his expulsion would be an
act of necessity, both in relation to himself and to others. Hence it
is obvious from the nature of the case, as well as from the Word of
God, that before an unregenerate man is meet for heaven, the sentence
of condemnation which is recorded against him must, by an
act of free grace, be repealed, and then all his sins are forgiven.
In addition to this, he must be renewed in the spirit of his mind,
and a spiritual life must be breathed into him by the power of the
Divine Spirit."</p>

<p>"I have, Sir, I think, a clear apprehension of what you mean by
an act of grace in repealing the sentence of condemnation recorded
against us for the sins we commit; but you say, that in addition to
this we need the infusion into our mind of a new life, which you
call a spiritual life. But if we are pardoned by an act of free grace,
will not this secure to us an admission into heaven, without that
additional operation to which you refer, and of which I can form
no clear conception?"</p>

<p>"The exercise of free grace in pardoning a sinner is merely exempting
him from a liability to punishment in this world, and in
the world to come; but if he remain unrenewed, he will be the same
in his moral principles, in his predilections, and antipathies, after he
is pardoned, as he was while under a sentence of condemnation. He
will feel no filial reverence for God; the love of Christ will not glow
in his soul; he will possess no aptitude to hold fellowship with the
pure spirits of the celestial world; nor can he live and move amongst
them with dignity and ease, as one of their order."</p>

<p>"I perceive, Sir, the drift of your meaning; but yet it is enveloped
in mysticism. One moment I seem to have it; but it is gone ere I
can lay hold of it; it flits before me, and vanishes. However, there
is one question which I shall feel obliged by you replying to: By
what process can I originate, or get originated, this new spiritual
life into my soul; and how must I set about it?"</p>

<p>"You cannot, Sir, originate it. As you cannot pardon yourself,
neither can you renew yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>This remark fell with terrible force on his spirit, and cast a deep
gloom on his countenance. He looked fearfully anxious, like a man
who, on gaining an eminence apparently beyond the reach of the
tide, sees his connection with the shore cut off by the unexpected
rising of the waters.</p>

<p>"I am, then, in a hopeless condition! It appears, Sir, from your
statement, that I came into existence in a state of spiritual death,
and consequent condemnation, without possessing any self-quickening
power. This, if true, forces upon me the conviction that I
must look upon myself as a poor unfortunate being, involved in a
tremendous calamity, which I could not avoid, and from which I
cannot extricate myself. Why, Sir, I am in a state of hopeless
and irrecoverable misery."</p>

<p>"No, Sir, neither irrecoverable nor hopeless; for God, who is rich
in mercy to pardon, is also rich in mercy to renew and quicken you
into newness of life."</p>

<p>"But will He do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you are willing to have it done."</p>

<p>"Willing! Sir; I am anxious to be saved, and saved on any terms,
and by any process. I am willing to submit to any privations, any
self-humiliation, any physical or mental tortures, to obtain the hope
of salvation."</p>

<p>"One of the principles of God's wise and gracious administration
is embodied in the following absolute promise made to his ancient
people, accompanied by its contingent condition:&mdash;'A new heart
also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I
will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you
an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause
you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and
do them. Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be enquired
of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them
with men like a flock' (Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27, 37). A new spirit and
a new heart is what you need, and now want; this God alone can
give, and for this you must pray with great earnestness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>We now arrived at Aston, where, after having tea, we sauntered
out as before into the garden, and entered the grotto to admire the
view. Here Mr. Ryder resumed the thread of our conversation by
saying:&mdash;"Permit me to ask you a question, which I feel to be important.
When the Divine Spirit breathes this spiritual life into
the soul of a man who has been living in a state of spiritual death, is
he conscious of the change produced?"</p>

<p>"In some rare instances, I believe that a man does feel the action
of the renewing and life-giving power of the Divine Spirit, at the
very instant of time he is passing from death to life, though he
may not then know by whom the spiritual operation is performed."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, as it is only rarely that such a sudden transition from
death to life takes place, by what signs are we to determine its actual
occurrence, when it is the result of a more lengthened process?"</p>

<p>"I believe the infusion of spiritual life in the soul of man is always
an instantaneous act, though a long time may and often does elapse
before he actually knows that he is quickened into newness of life.
And in all cases the signs by which we may decide as to its actual
occurrence, are very similar to those by which we determine the
reality of our physical existence. For example, I am conscious that
I am alive, because I breathe, feel, see, and hear, which I could not
do if I were not alive. By a similar criterion we arrive at a satisfactory
belief of the reality of our spiritual life. I am made alive
from the dead; and as a proof of it, I can utter the voice of prayer
and of praise. I <em>feel</em> sin to be a loathsome burden, offensive to my
taste; I can <em>see</em> the glory of Christ displayed in his life, in his sufferings,
and in his death. I can <em>hear</em> the voice of the Lord speaking
to me in his promises, to comfort and strengthen me; and in his
precepts, commanding my subjection and resignation to his sovereign
will; I can <em>walk</em> in the way of his commandments, and feel
obedience to be a source of gratitude and delight. I often <em>hunger</em>
and <em>thirst</em> after a more perfect conformity to his righteousness; and
now my meditations on God are sweet and delightful; and I can
say&mdash;'Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
earth that I desire beside thee' (Psal. lxxiii. 25). These are the
unmistakeable signs of spiritual life."</p>

<p>"You certainly, Sir, have supplied me with ample materials for
thinking and reflection, and made an opening for my more easy
understanding of the Bible. But there is one question of a more
direct personal nature, which I wish to propose, and it is this&mdash;What
am I to do? I am restless and unhappy. I want relief. Where,
and how, can I obtain it? What positive thing am I to do, or suffer,
to obtain it? That is the great question with me <em>now</em>. I perceive
that the ulterior design of the Christian scheme of revelation is to
restore man to the moral state from which he is fallen; but I have
now to do with the present time, and the present state of my mind.
What am I to do, or suffer, to gain peace of mind, and get that new
spiritual life, of which you have been speaking?"</p>

<p>"I am happy, Sir, that it is in my power to give a specific, and I
trust a satisfactory reply to your question. You are awakened out
of your long dormant state of moral insensibility, to see and to feel
your real character and condition in relation to God and eternity.
This is the primary cause of your mental disquietude and restlessness.
You have sought for relief in the outward forms of religion,
and in the services and sacraments of the Church; but you have not
succeeded in obtaining it. These expedients have proved to you
the mirage of hope, not the well-spring of relief. Happily, there is
a relieving power yet in reserve, which will not deceive or disappoint
you&mdash;'For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which
was lost' (Luke xix. 10). As Jesus Christ came into the world to
save sinners, he will not refuse to save any sinner who makes his
appeal to his compassion and his power. Indeed, he assures us&mdash;'All
that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out' (John vi. 37)."</p>

<p>He now arose, evidently much impressed, and walked slowly out
of the grotto, pacing to and fro along the gravel walk. After some
time I moved off in an opposite direction; but at length we again
met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope, Sir," he said, "you will excuse my uncourteous act in
leaving you; but I wished, by a little calm reflection, to settle in my
mind the important statement which you have given me, before
the vivid impressions which it produced went off. I trust I shall
long remember this interview; and I hope the day may come when
you will hail me as a fellow-disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>I then prayed with him, and shortly after took my departure. I
did not see his sister on this occasion, as she was from home, but I
left a copy of Dr. Doddridge's <cite>Sermons on Regeneration</cite>, with a note
begging her acceptance of it, and a request that she would read it
carefully.</p>

<p>Several months after this visit, when I had returned home to my
ordinary duties, I received the subjoined letter from Mr. Ryder,
which I read with emotions of gratitude and praise to Him who
works all things after the counsel of his own will:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Aston</span>, <em>25th February, 18&mdash;</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The conversation which passed between us,
when I had the pleasure of a visit from you some months since, supplied
the clue which I had long been searching for, to a right understanding
of the Word of God on the great practical questions
relating to my present happiness and final salvation. I know that
my knowledge is still very superficial, but I trust I now understand
the hidden mystery; what it is to pass from death to life; and from
a state of guilt and condemnation to pardon and acceptance. I
have taken the one decisive step, and cast myself at the feet of the
Saviour, pleading his own promise, and he has given me rest. I
have now obtained&mdash;what I long sought for in vain&mdash;peace of mind,
and a good hope of final happiness; because I have been diverted
from the refuge of lies, in which I too long trusted, to the true
source of consolation.</p>

<p>"You will not be surprised to hear, that the ministry of the Rev.
Mr. Cole became more and more distasteful, as I advanced in my
knowledge of Christ and the mystery of redemption, till at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
I reluctantly withdrew from his church, which I have attended from
my childhood. I now attend the church of the Rev. Mr. Guion, an
excellent preacher and pastor, whom I believe you know. And it
is with no slight emotions of joyous delight, that I have it in my
power to inform you, that my beloved sister has been brought to
feel the renewing influence of religion on her heart. This blessed
result has been brought about by reading the incomparable sermons
of Dr. Doddridge, which you so kindly gave to her. Being favoured
with the enlightened and soul-searching ministry of our excellent
pastor, she soon obtained joy and peace in believing. While I was
left to wander in darkness, or in twilight, through many an anxious
month, at times nearly despairing of a successful issue, her translation
from darkness into light was almost instantaneous. She is now
my helper in the Lord; and the affection which always subsisted
between us is now doubly strengthened by the ties of Christian
love and sympathy.</p>

<p>"I hope that ere long you will again be in this part of the
country; and I need not say how glad my sister and I should be to
see you.&mdash;With every sentiment of respect, in which Anna joins,
believe me, yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">J. Ryder</span>."

<h2>THE SCEPTIC RECLAIMED.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_535.jpg" alt="B" width="100" height="108" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Before leaving Fairmount to return home, I was unexpectedly
gratified by a letter from Mr. Gordon, who
had learned, from a mutual acquaintance, of my having
gone to pay a visit to my friends in the west of England.
His communication, upon the whole, much pleased me, and
revived hopes which had almost ceased to exist. It satisfied me
that his mind was restless, yielding in some slight degree to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
force of facts and evidence, though he still clung pertinaciously to
his sceptical notions. He wrote as follows:&mdash;"I have been prosecuting
my inquiries on what you call the grand question, having
read carefully Dr. Bogue's essay, which you kindly presented to me.
I have also conned over some of the facts and evidences which you
brought forward at our last interview.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This, I presume, you will
say is taking a step or two in the right direction; and I suppose you
will wish to know the practical result. I will first give you the
negative: it has not issued in what you would hail as a glorious
triumph&mdash;my conversion to the Christian faith. No; I am what I
was when you left me&mdash;still a decided unbeliever. My heart recoils
from admitting that a theory of religion, enveloped in such mystery,
and accompanied by such conditions, can claim a Divine origin.
However, this much I will confess, that it has led me to revise, in
some slight degree, my own theory of belief, or what you may call
my disbelief. You will excuse me going into detail, as that would
spin out this letter to a tedious length. I admit, then, that Christianity
may work very beneficially amongst savages; and it may promote
the happiness of persons of intelligence and taste, who are
trained up under its influence. I have now no desire to exterminate
it. Indeed, I would rather consent to let the venerable tree, which
has taken such deep root in popular prejudices, or, if you prefer it,
in popular sympathies, remain to afford shade and shelter to you
who regard it as the tree of life, than I would touch it to injure it.
No, Sir; I respect the taste and feelings of others too much to wish
to deprive them of the object of their attachment and veneration."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Gordon concluded his letter by saying that he hoped to have
the pleasure of seeing me in London, as he presumed that I should
pass through the metropolis on my way to my own town.</p>

<p>About a week after receiving this letter I quitted Fairmount,
leaving Mrs. Orme, who was still to remain for a few weeks longer
at Rockhill. From the pressure of my engagements in the metropolis
I was unable to make out my purposed call on Mr. Gordon. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
occasion, however, about four months afterwards, to go to London to
preach a charity sermon, I set out one evening to see him; but on
reaching his house, was concerned to find that he was in a very precarious
state of health, and had been unable to go out for some time.
On sending up my card, I was at once admitted, and found him in
the drawing-room reclining on the sofa. He looked very ill; but,
judging from the expression of his countenance, I thought he was
glad to see me. On making some inquiries as to the length of his
confinement, and the nature of his disorder, he made a reply which
brought on a lengthened conversation.</p>

<p>"It is now," he said, "nearly three months since I was in the city;
and it is doubtful whether I shall ever go there again."</p>

<p>"Is your disorder, then, of such a threatening character?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, it baffles Lawrence. But he is now trying another
medicine, which he hopes will take effect; if not, he says, I must
prepare for the worst."</p>

<p>"I hope, then, you are making the necessary preparations."</p>

<p>"To be candid, Sir, I am the same man as when we had the last
chat on the question of Christian missions, with this only difference&mdash;then
I was in vigorous health, but now I am prostrated by disease,
and disease which threatens to be fatal, though it does not give
me much pain."</p>

<p>"You must no doubt feel some anxiety when so near death&mdash;on
the eve of the final extinction of your being, or of passing into another
world of existence, and for ever?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I am no stoic; and therefore I feel emotions both novel
and painful. I would rather live than die, especially if I could
recover my usual health and energy; because it is better to be, than
not to be. The prospect of a termination to my existence is no
pleasing theme for reflection."</p>

<p>"Then you still believe that when death comes you will cease to
exist, and perish for ever like the beasts of the field?"</p>

<p>"That is my belief."</p>

<p>"But you may be mistaken."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>"I admit it, because mere belief and positive knowledge are two
very different things."</p>

<p>"Then you are living in a state of uncertainty; as you know not
whether you will be annihilated or live on for ever in another state
of existence. Surely this must give rise to some fearful and depressing
thoughts."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot say that it does, because I think the Deity who
brought me into existence without my solicitation, and who has given
me such a large portion of enjoyment throughout life, will still befriend
me, if he decide that I shall continue to exist after death in
another world. That I shall continue to exist, however, I do not
expect."</p>

<p>"But do you not perceive the fallacious ground on which your
expectation is placed, unless you believe, and without any clear evidence,
that the Deity has made a special dispensation in your behalf?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you."</p>

<p>"Why, you infer that your future condition of existence, if you are
to live after death, will be similar to the one which you have enjoyed
here, and which has been, upon the whole, a very favourable one.
Suppose another person proceed on the same principle, he must infer,
that his future condition will be a most painful and unfortunate one,
simply because his present condition is so. There is, then, a self-evident
and a dangerous fallacy in the proposition which allows two
persons to draw from it such opposite inferences, the one for, and the
other against himself, and without any reference to personal conduct
or character."</p>

<p>"There may be a logical fallacy in my proposition, and in my
reasoning on it; but it is the only ground of hope, when, in some
moments of misgiving, I am led to admit the possibility of passing
into another state of existence."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you are reduced to the necessity of making one admission,
which is a terrible rebuke to your sceptical theory."</p>

<p>"Indeed! and what is that?"</p>

<p>"That your position, in relation to death, is an unenviable one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
especially when placed in comparison with that of a believer in
Christ; indeed, it is one which should make you recoil in terror."</p>

<p>"I admit it. Yes, Sir, if you were in the same condition with myself,
you would, I have no doubt, have visions of celestial glory
flitting before your imagination, and you would be in ecstasy. Yes,
a believer in Christ has a great advantage over us, when he approaches
the crisis of his destiny. No gloomy thoughts or anxieties
harass his soul; but on the contrary, a brilliant prospect stretching
far into eternity opens to his view. Yes, a believer in Christianity
ought to feel a transport of joy in anticipation of his death."</p>

<p>"Then, on your own admission, death to a believer in Christ is
the morning star of a glorious day; but to a sceptic, it is the dark
shadow of coming night."</p>

<p>"I admit you have brilliant visions, when death is coming to
bear you off; we have none, we see nothing but darkness, and feel
at times the terror of uncertainty. I admit you occupy the vantage
ground then; you stand on what you believe is a rock; beneath us
is the moving quicksand. Yes, you die in general better than we
do, or can do. There is no denying this; and I shall not attempt
to disguise it."</p>

<p>"Your condition, my dear friend, in my apprehension, is truly
appalling. It agonizes me. I see you standing on the edge of a
tremendous precipice. In a moment you may be lost, and perish,
and for ever. Shall I pray with you, before I leave you? The
prayer of faith may prevail for your rescue and salvation."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, dear Sir, without supposing that I undervalue your
generous friendship. You would save me, I know, if you could.
But I have no faith, and therefore it would not be honest to appear
devout, and I cannot compel myself to believe."</p>

<p>I called again before I left London, but as he was asleep, I did
not see him; but I saw his housekeeper, a very intelligent, pious
woman, in whose integrity I knew he had great confidence. She
informed me, that when sitting with her master during one very
restless night; and thinking, from some heavy sighs which he occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
heaved, that some new feelings were stirring within him,
she said to him&mdash;"It is a great pity, Sir, that you will cling so
firmly to your infidel opinions when they cannot comfort you. You
had better look up to the Saviour; he is able, and he is willing to
comfort and save you."</p>

<p>"Well, Mary," he replied, "I admit it would be better if I could
believe in a Saviour, as you do, than to remain in my present state of
uncertainty; but I have no faith&mdash;I cannot compel myself to believe."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, pray to the Lord Jesus, and he will give you faith to
trust in him for salvation. He has compassion for them that are
out of the right way."</p>

<p>"But how can I pray, when I have no faith in prayer? It may
all be true what you believe, and if it should, I am irrecoverably
lost, and for ever; but I have no faith in such a tremendous issue."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, such a tremendous issue may be certain, even though
you do not believe it; and the bare possibility of its occurrence
should alarm you."</p>

<p>"I admit that, but I can't compel myself to believe."</p>

<p>I returned home with a heavy heart, feeling as a humane person
feels, on coming out of the prison, where he has had the last agonizing
interview with an old friend, whom he has left under the sentence
of death. Having requested Mr. Gordon's housekeeper to let
me know if any change took place in his health, I received a note
from her a few weeks afterwards, saying, the crisis was past, and
that he was so far restored, that he was now at Maidenhead, trying
the effect of a change of air and scene. This gave me pleasure&mdash;as
a respite sometimes issues in a rescue. His form was ever before me.
Many a petition did I offer up to the Hearer of prayer in his behalf;
and more than once, on rising from my knees, I felt a strong persuasion
that the prayer of faith would prevail. It was after a very
remarkable season of special devotion, when I pleaded with the Lord
with intense and hallowed earnestness, that I received from him
the following letter, which was an ample recompense for all my labours
and anxieties:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I yield at last. My only hope for pardon
and peace is in the precious blood of Christ. My heart is too full
to write much. It is full to overflowing. Do come and see me, and
I will tell you all. I can secure you a spare room not far from my
own lodgings.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Arthur Gordon</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I set off immediately, and spent several days with him; and had
from him and his housekeeper a detailed statement of the occurrences
which had taken place, and which I will now reduce to continuous
order, for the gratification of the reader. He had taken lodgings in a
cottage occupied by a poor but pious family, and which was pleasantly
situated near the banks of the Thames. Though he had no regard
for the exercises of family devotion, yet he had no very strong antipathy
to them. He therefore felt no annoyance by hearing the good
man read and pray with his family morning and evening, though
no one knew that he was in the habit of listening. The simple, yet
earnest petitions (as Mr. Gordon afterwards confessed) which were
offered up to the Hearer of prayer, in behalf of the stranger, for his
restoration to the enjoyment of perfect health, and that his affliction
might be sanctified to his spiritual benefit, often made a deep impression
on his heart, but it passed away without any appearance
of a beneficial result.</p>

<p>An incident now occurred which had nearly proved fatal to him,
but it was overruled for good. He went with a party of friends to
spend the day at Marlow; and as they calculated on the probability
of seeing some wild ducks, one gentleman took his gun with him.
On their return down the river in the evening, they resolved, as it
felt rather cold, to walk the last two or three miles. In stepping
out of the boat, one of the party slipped, and at that moment the
loaded gun, which he carried in his hand, went off; Mr. Gordon,
who was a little in advance, and stooping down to fasten his shoe,
fell, and his hat was blown to shivers. All were terror-struck,
under the impression that he was killed; but it was soon discovered
that he had sustained no injury, beyond a slight wound on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
side of his forehead, and the tip of his ear, which were slightly
grazed. They pressed around him with their congratulations; one
facetiously remarking, that he must have been born under a lucky
star, to dodge death so dexterously, when it was so near him.
The accident, and the escape, naturally engaged more of their conversation
than any of the other occurrences of the day; but there
was no reference to the special providence of God, except in the
usual strain of sceptical derision. "A pious believer," said the
facetious man, "would be for kneeling down, and offering up a tribute
of thanksgiving for your lucky escape, Gordon; and so should
I, if I believed in a special Providence."</p>

<p>"I don't believe," said another, "that God ever interferes in such
little matters; if he did, he could easily have prevented the slip of
the foot, which was the first moving cause of the explosion; and had
he done that, Gordon would have saved his hat, and gone home
without his scars."</p>

<p>These remarks, which at any other time would have been in harmony
with his opinions and sentiments, by his own admission, now
grated harshly on his ears; he felt his spirit recoil from them, and
for the first time in his life wished himself out of such company.
He was somewhat astonished, as he confessed to me, by the suddenly
awakened antipathies, which beat so strongly in his heart. On
arriving at his lodgings, he related to the family the particulars
of his narrow escape from death; when the good man exclaimed,
in a subdued tone of pious reverence, "The Lord be praised for protecting
you in such an hour of danger. This, Sir, is an instance of
what the Psalmist calls preventing mercy, for which you should be
truly grateful to the Lord."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon knew that his servant united with the family in their
evening devotions; and thinking that this accident and escape would
form a subject of reference in the prayers of the pious cottager, he
kept his door ajar, and sat and listened. He heard his servant say,
"My master is as kind a man as walks on the earth, and is thankful
for any attentions which are paid to him by any one; but he has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
gratitude in his heart to the God of his mercies. He lives, as the
apostle says, without God in the world."</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied the good man, "if he offer up no thanksgivings
to the Lord for his miraculous escape from death, we will do it for
him; and pray that he may be brought to feel as a child of our
heavenly Father ought to feel." He then read the sixth chapter of
the Gospel of Matthew, remarking, at the conclusion, that it was a
great privilege to be able to believe the consolatory and soul-sustaining
truths which they had been reading. One sentence in his
prayer was uttered with emphatic earnestness&mdash;"We thank thee,
O Lord, for preserving the life of the stranger now sojourning with
us, when it was so near death; and we pray that he may feel towards
thee as a child ought to feel towards his heavenly Father." This
touched his heart.</p>

<p>"I never," he said to me, "felt such an emotion as I experienced
when that simple prayer was uttered. It was as thrilling and
as powerful as it was sudden and unexpected. I immediately arose
and seated myself on the sofa, and was soon absorbed in a train of
deep thought. Yes, death came very near me to-night. He has
marked the signs of his nearness in the scar wounds on my forehead
and my ear. Was it mere chance which gave me a hair-breadth
escape from a sudden death? Yes, says infidelity; God never interferes
in little matters. But would it have been to me a little matter
if I had had an arm blown off, or a leg broken, or been sent out of
life into another world; and probably to &mdash;&mdash;. No. It would have
been a great matter <em>then</em>. Is my preservation from death to be regarded
as a little matter? Was God away from the spot where my
friend's foot slipped? Yes, says infidelity; and I should have responded
to this saying before the event occurred; but I cannot <em>now</em>.
I doubt my own faith; I renounce it. It may do at a club, or a
convivial party; but it won't do for the spot where death was
coming, but where the victim has been miraculously rescued from
his power. '<span class="smcap">As a child ought to feel towards his heavenly
Father!</span>' Beautiful expression! Yes, I ought to feel grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
to God; but I have never considered him as standing in the relation
of a father to me. But has he not on this occasion acted like
one?"</p>

<p>On turning and looking carelessly round the room, he saw his
copy of Tremaine lying on the side-board. He took it up and
opened it; the chapter on Providence caught his eye, and he read it.
"This," he confessed to me, he found to be but "starlight-reading;
clear, but cold; brilliant, but wanting in power; expanding the intellect,
and charming the imagination, but not finding its way to
the heart. I read, and believed; read, and yet doubted. I was," he
said, "completely bewildered; but I recollect saying, O that I had
the faith of the cottager, or my servant, my mind would be in perfect
peace."</p>

<p>His housekeeper, who, as yet, was ignorant of the novel process
of thinking which was going on in his mind, informed me that she
was astonished and delighted one evening by his asking her for the
loan of her Bible. She fetched it, and on giving it to him, said,
"That book, Sir, will do you good, if you pray over it when you are
reading it." He read the sixth chapter of Matthew; read it several
times; and when referring to it in our conversation, he said, "What
a difference, Sir, between the two readings! Tremaine reasons
closely and clearly; he almost demonstrates and compels belief; but
there is no pathos, no power; the heart still remains sceptical and
unmoved. Jesus Christ asserts, commands, and promises; the
heart is captivated, and induced to place its trust in God. Yes!
'it must be,' as the pious cottager remarked, 'an inestimable privilege
to be able to believe the consolatory and soul-sustaining truths
which I have now been reading.' I believe <span class="smcap">now</span>. But how is this?
Logic has not been reasoning. My intellect is dormant; and yet
it is spell-bound by novel and solemn thoughts. It is making
new spiritual discoveries, which, I believe, are grand realities, but
which I have long despised and rejected as legendary tales; and I
feel tranquil. And yet, as the process of reflection goes on, I feel
again bewildered. My calm is becoming a tumult; and out of satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
springs up anxiety. Is this a delusion, or am I waking up
out of a mental torpor amidst sublime spiritual realities? I am conscious
of a change which has come upon me, and very unexpectedly."</p>

<p>"You do not doubt its reality?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir; it is no sham. I am as conscious of its reality as I am
of my own existence. I am no sceptic <em>now</em>. I have no hostile feeling
<em>now</em> against the remedial scheme of salvation. I adore Christ
<em>now</em>. I can give him my heart. I am astonished by my own utterances;
but they are the genuine expressions of my feelings."</p>

<p>"I presume, Sir, you ascribe the great change which has taken
place in your belief, and in your moral taste, to a supernatural
cause; to what the apostle calls the grace of God?"</p>

<p>"I do, Sir. There are three things which satisfy me that this
marvellous change is the work of God. In the first place, I had no
conception that such a change was either necessary or possible; in
the next place, I had no more power or inclination to effect it myself
than I have to raise a dead man to life; and then it has been
produced so suddenly, preceded by no intimations or anticipations
of such an occurrence, and by such apparently inadequate means.
The simple prayers of the rustic cottager subdued me. They touched
my heart. I could, as you know, withstand the assaults of the most
acute and powerful reasoning; your persuasive eloquence touched
no cord of my heart. I could repel, with a sarcasm, the most awful
warnings; and stand immoveable when death was advancing to
execute the penal sentence; but I could not stand out against the
simple prayers of the pious cottager. Indeed, I felt more inclined
to yield than to resist. It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous
in my eyes. He made me willing in the day of his power. On this
principle it can be accounted for, but on no other. Reason, as well
as gratitude, compels me to say&mdash;By the grace of God, I am what I
am. But O, my friend, where can I find language to give full expression
to the astonishment and gratitude which I feel when reflecting
on the long-suffering and the forbearance of God, whose
majesty I have so often insulted, and whose authority I have set at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
nought, defying his threatenings, and spurning his overtures of
mercy! How marvellous the condescending compassion and grace
of the Lord Jesus Christ, who has at last brought me to penitence
and contrition, and given me a hope of salvation!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you now recal to your recollection, at times, some of
the subjects of our former discussions; both your objections to the
various parts of revealed truth, and how I endeavoured to refute
them?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, I may mention, that from the outset, on the
Saturday evening we first met,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and through every succeeding
encounter, I had a latent apprehension that you were right; and
that your belief, with its consolations and prospects, was far more
conducive to human happiness, than my disbelief, with its suspicions
and uncertainties; I clearly saw, that on your hypothesis, the loss of
life, which is the greatest of human possessions, would be an incalculable
gain; but on mine, it would be an irreparable loss. When
reasoning in my calmer moments on these data, I arrived at this
conclusion&mdash;for man's sake the Christian faith <em>ought</em> to be a genuine
faith, even if it is not so; and I recollect when you were assigning
the causes which invest the name of Jesus Christ with such great
power over the human mind on its passing through scenes of extreme
privation and peril, and especially when passing from one
world to another, I felt that I would gladly exchange my disbelief
and its uncertainties, for your faith and its assurances. I now, Sir,
by the grace of God, can add my testimony to the truthfulness of
what you asserted in that encounter. The Christian faith is both
a renovating and consolatory power, and it does the work ascribed
to it; it gives peace to a wounded spirit, and a hope full of immortality
to the guilty and morally worthless."</p>

<p>"You would not now willingly be what you once were?"</p>

<p>"Be what I once was! no, Sir. As readily suppose that a glorified
spirit, if left to his own choice, would choose to come back to
earth, to re-tread its polluting soil, to raise again the standard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
rebellion against the Majesty of heaven, and again intermingle
with the workers of iniquity. Be what I once was! no, Sir. Like
the man in the gospel who found the pearl of great price, I have no
wish to lose what I have miraculously found; I have found the
Messiah, Jesus Christ the Saviour, mighty to save; and to his service
I now consecrate myself for life and for ever."</p>

<p>He took me one evening to the place where the gun-shot accident
happened, and when pointing with his stick to the spot where he
fell, he stood a while speechless, the tears trickling down his cheeks,
when he exclaimed, under the impulse of strong emotion, "What a
mercy that I was not blown from this spot into hell! On this spot,
Sir, I have stood every evening since the accident occurred, to offer
up my adorations and thanksgiving to the God of my mercies, and
to echo the utterance of Paul, 'This is a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners; of whom I am chief' (1 Tim. i. 15). Yes, Sir, and I will
visit it when the gray hairs of age hang upon me, if I am spared
to old age; and shall I ever forget it when in heaven? But the
gun-shot and my escape would have proved the materials for a profane
joke in a convivial party, had it not been for the sovereign
grace of God, who employed it as the precursor of my salvation&mdash;'Bless
the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his
holy name'" (Psal. ciii. 1).</p>

<p>He continued at Maidenhead till his health was thoroughly re-established,
and then he returned to London. On his reappearance
at the counting-house, in which he had long held an important office,
he received the hearty congratulations of the firm, and of all his
fellow-clerks, by whom he was greatly respected, for his close application
to his duties, his gentlemanly habits, and the kindness of his
disposition.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he had occasion to pass through my town on
some business of his employers, and paid me a visit. We spent a
very pleasant evening together. He then informed me that he had
had a visit from Mr. Newton, and another infidel friend; who called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
with their congratulations on his escape from the gun-shot, and the
recovery of his health, and to propose an excursion to Greenwich,
with a party, on the following Sunday. This invitation he at once
declined, and added, "You probably will be surprised to hear that
I renounce as false, and as fatal, all the sceptical sentiments and
opinions I once held; and now embrace with gratitude and joy the
glorious gospel of Christ, as a true and sublime revelation of mercy
and of grace. In future, my Sabbaths will be held sacred to public
worship, in preference to any other exercises or pursuits. And I
would earnestly entreat you to turn your serious attention to the
paramount claims of the gospel; its rejection, as a legend of superstition,
will embitter your reflections and appal your anticipations
in a dying hour." They listened to this with profound astonishment,
making no other remark than simply wishing him well, and
then abruptly left him.</p>

<p>I took occasion from this reference to Newton and his companion,
to remark, that it would have been a great blessing for himself and
others, if he had undergone this change at an earlier period of his
life.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir," he replied, and the tear stood in his eye as he spoke,
"I reflect with shame, and at times with agonizing regret, on the
efforts I have made to seduce others from the way of righteousness
and peace. My friend Lewellin has happily escaped from the evil
course into which I led him on his first settlement in London,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and
he is now a bright star in the church of Jesus Christ; but I fear
that some have passed into the eternal world, under the fatal delusions
with which I perverted their minds. These two old friends
who lately paid me a visit of congratulation, and others still living,
who are lost in the crowd of gaiety and dissipation, have sustained
incalculable injury from the influence of my example, and the fatal
tendency of my former sentiments and opinions. A recollection of
these facts will entail upon me bitter regret and stinging remorse
through the whole course of my life; and though I may obtain mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
from Him whose name I have so often blasphemed, yet from them I
can expect nothing but the severest invective for having misled
them, or the keenest satire and reproach for turning a renegade,
as they will term it, to the system of scepticism we once professed
in common."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE RECTOR'S DEATH-BED.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_549.jpg" alt="F" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">For several years Mr. Ingleby's health had been gradually
declining, but to the last he displayed great vigour
of intellect and vivacity of spirit. When I saw him on
the occasion of my wedding visit to Mr. Lewellin, he
appeared to be still hale and active, notwithstanding the great age
which he had attained. In common with the rest of his friends, I
expected that he might still be spared for a few years to instruct
them by his counsels, and animate them by his example. Mr. Roscoe's
death, however, proved a severe shock to him; he fell into a
state of nervous depression; and after a violent cold which he took
in going to visit a poor cottager, in a remote part of his parish, his
parishioners began to fear that he would soon be removed from
them. For several Sabbaths he was confined to the rectory; but
when he grew a little better, he resumed the discharge of his pastoral
duties. Though he brought into the pulpit the stores of knowledge
which he had been collecting for many years, and felt his spirit still
glowing with the ardour of an intense affection for the spiritual and
eternal welfare of his hearers, his energy was now considerably
abated; his voice, which was originally full and commanding, became
low and enfeebled, and he often appeared exhausted by fatigue,
even before he had half finished the service.</p>
</div>

<p>We sometimes see a congregation, which a minister has collected
together in the days of his vigour, forsaking him in his old age, to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
their homage to the rising sun of popularity; preferring the voice of
a comparative stranger to that of their former shepherd; but the
venerable Ingleby was never deserted. The people pressed to hear
him when the silver locks of age adorned his head, with as much
eagerness as when he possessed all the energy of youth; and felt as
deep an interest in the last services which he conducted, as in any
that had preceded them. It must be admitted that his situation did
not bring him within the immediate influence of any strong competition
for public favour; but though many of his congregation resided
much nearer other clergymen, they nevertheless, at all seasons of the
year, continued regular in their attendance on the ministrations of
Mr. Ingleby to the close of his life. This attachment to their pastor
took its rise in the usefulness of his public labours; and as he had
uniformly conducted himself amongst them as a holy man of God,
devoting his time and his influence to promote their happiness, his
character rose in their esteem as circumstances gave him an opportunity
of developing it. He acted on the following maxims, which
were given him by an aged clergyman, not long after he took orders,
and the practical utility of whose advice Mr. Ingleby soon experienced
in securing him the permanent regard of his flock:&mdash;"Preserve
the sanctity of your public character in the intercourse of
private and social life. Do not visit your people often, except when
they need your visits, and then convince them, that while you have
no time to spare for the purposes of amusement or recreation, you
are ever ready to attend to the claims of pastoral duty. Avoid engaging
in the commerce of the world; yet never think that you are
acting beneath the dignity of your station when engaged in giving
advice to the inexperienced, or assisting others by your counsels, to
guide their affairs with discretion. Let the poor of your flock know
that their pastor is their friend in adversity, their advocate when
oppressed, and will be their comforter when on the bed of sickness
or of death."</p>

<p>About a month before his decease he arose on the Sabbath morning
free from pain, the spirit of former times came upon him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
he felt that he could get through the labours of the day, without
availing himself of the assistance which his neighbour, the Rev. Mr.
Guion, had so kindly offered. The text from which he addressed the
congregation was taken from 2 Pet. i. 13, 14:&mdash;"Yea, I think it meet,
as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in
remembrance; knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle,
even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me." When he
read the words, the attention of the people was immediately fixed on
him. The effect which was produced by the delivery of this discourse
was very powerful. It was undoubtedly much aided by the
peculiar circumstances of the speaker, who was grown gray and
infirm in the service of the people, and who in his introduction
informed them, that he was led to the choice of the subject, under
an impression, which left no doubt of the propriety of its application
to himself. The aspect of the preacher, pale, emaciated, standing
on the verge of eternity&mdash;the simplicity and majesty of his sentiments&mdash;the
sepulchral solemnity of a voice which seemed to issue
from the shades, combined with the intrinsic dignity of the subject&mdash;perfectly
quelled the audience with tenderness and terror, and produced
such a scene of audible weeping as was perhaps never surpassed.
All other emotions were absorbed in devotional feeling; it
seemed to us as though we were permitted for a short space to look
into eternity, and every sublunary object vanished before "the powers
of the world to come." "I had often heard him," says Mr. Stevens,
in a letter which I received from him, "when he was more
energetic, but never when he was more impressive; when he discovered
more originality of genius, but never when he displayed
more intensity of feeling; when he employed a more polished and
a more imaginative style of address, but never when he spoke with
more authority and power; and, thinking with the rest of the audience,
that he was now terminating his labours, I felt a high gratification
that he was enabled to bring them to a close with so much
credit to himself, as the able and faithful minister of the New Testament.
His appeal to the people, after he had finished his discourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
and closed his Bible, delivered in simple and unaffected language,
subdued the whole audience, and left us, when he had finished it, no
alternative but an involuntary burst of sorrow that we should hear
no more that voice to which we had so often listened."</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the Rector's farewell sermon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dearly beloved brethren, I have now served you in the
ministry of the gospel for more than forty years, and am on the eve
of closing my labours amongst you. Looking back on my life, I discover
many defects in my character, and many imperfections in the
manner in which I have discharged my public duties; these I most
humbly deplore; but I trust they have been only the ordinary infirmities
of a Christian minister, who has uniformly aimed to reach a
higher point of excellence than he could ever attain. If I cannot, like
the great apostle of the Gentiles, appeal to the holiness and unblameableness
of my behaviour amongst you; yet I trust I can to the ardour
of my affection, and the fidelity of my public ministrations; and
while I would entreat you to cast the veil of charity over all the
blemishes of my character, I would, at the same time, charge 'every
one of you, as a father doth his children, that ye would walk worthy
of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.' The
truth which I have preached to you is now my support in prospect of
the scene which is before me. The time of my departure is at hand.
My course is nearly finished. I shall soon stand before the judgment-seat
of Christ. My eternal state shall soon be decided; and
I shall soon know the final decision. But I am not alarmed. I do
not dread death. The judgment-seat does not appal me. The final
sentence awakens no fearful forebodings of sorrow. I am looking
for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. Whether
I shall ever be permitted to address you again from this pulpit, is
known only to Him who works all things after the counsel of his
own will; nor do I feel very solicitous to do so. If I should, I shall
appear amongst you in weakness, if not in fear and in much trembling;
and if I should not, I hope you will be provided with another
minister, who will, either in this church, or elsewhere, as the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
may direct, preach, to you with more energy, and with more success,
the glorious gospel which I have so often proclaimed to you. But I
cannot leave you without saying, that as I have not shunned to
declare the whole truth of God in the most faithful manner, if any
of you should eventually perish, you will not have it in your power
to say that it was owing to my unfaithfulness. Any of you perish!
What! will you reject the counsel of God against yourselves? Will
you refuse to come to Jesus Christ, that you may have life? Will
you neglect the great salvation, which has been made known unto
you; and sink down to endless woe under the accumulated guilt of
your impenitence? Must I be compelled to appear as a witness
against any of you, in that day when God shall judge the secrets of
men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel? and, instead of seeing
you accepted in the Beloved, shall I see you banished from the presence
of the Lord for ever? And must I now terminate my labours
amongst you, under the awful impression, that while they have been
the means of saving some, they have become the innocent occasion
of aggravating the just condemnation of others? and thus, like the
apostle, while to some I have been the savour of life unto life, must
I be to others the savour of death unto death?"</p>

<p>When the service was over, many of the people crowded into the
aisle though which he passed; some stood in the porch of the church,
others along the pathway which led across the graveyard, and some
few followed him to the rectory, to shake hands with him and bid
him farewell; sorrowing, like the elders of Ephesus, when they fell
on Paul's neck and kissed him, most of all that they should see his
face no more. This spontaneous expression of attachment, on the
part of the people, deeply affected the venerable man, who wept as
he reiterated his parting benediction to the aged and the young;
and though he had strength given him to go through this trying
hour, yet, on entering his parlour, he complained of a giddiness,
and immediately fell fainting into the arms of Mr. Lewellin. This
excited considerable alarm through the whole family; and one of
the servants, in the paroxysm of her agony, sent forth the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
that her master was dead. On his being removed into the open air,
however, he soon revived, though, from the distorted appearance of
his countenance, it was evident that he had received a slight paralytic
stroke. He slept the greater part of the afternoon, but towards
evening became very animated, and for several hours conversed,
with great cheerfulness, on the immortality of the soul, and its final
and blissful destiny.</p>

<p>When Socrates was under sentence of death, he assured his friends,
who came to offer him their sympathy, that his chief support in
prospect of taking the fatal draught, was an expectation, not unmixed
with doubts, of a happy existence after death. From reasoning
and reflecting on the subject, he had been led to the conviction
that something of man remains after his decease, and that the condition
of good men will at last be better than that of the bad; but
he could not discover in all his researches, any positive evidence in
support of this opinion; and hence, while he expressed a hope of
entering the invisible world on passing away from this, he candidly
acknowledged that he had his doubts. "My situation," said the
venerable Ingleby, "is more enviable than that of the sage of
Athens. He doubted the immortality of the soul, while I firmly
believe it. And why do I believe it? Not because my nature revolts
at the thought of annihilation; not because I feel an instinctive
desire to outlive the triumphs of death; but because He who
sees the end from the beginning has said, that the wicked 'shall go
away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous shall go into
life eternal.'"</p>

<p>"We ought," said Mr. Lewellin, "to be very thankful to the
Author of revelation, for having announced the fact of our immortality
in such a clear and unequivocal manner; for it has always
struck me, that no other argument can be admitted as conclusive,
but the testimony of one who has an actual knowledge of an endless
futurity."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said Mr. Ingleby; "for how is it possible
for any being to know that I shall live for ever but that Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
Being who knows the end from the beginning? The communications
which we have in the Bible, on this subject, are professedly
his testimony; but if we reject these communications as fabulous,
we must either give up our hope of immortality, as an idle fancy,
or abandon ourselves to that state of dubious uncertainty, in which
the Athenian sage lived and died. And to this dilemma the infidels
of modern times are reduced; hence, while they cannot <em>disbelieve</em>
in a future state of existence, they cannot anticipate it with
any degree of confidence. If the gospel be, what they say it is, a
cunningly devised fable, which has its origin, not in the records of
truth, but in the invention of man, it is a fable which is eminently
conducive to human happiness; and I should consider that man my
enemy, who would even attempt to expose its fallacy. I am now
near the close of life, the tomb is opening to receive me, and ere
long I shall cease to be an inhabitant of this world. Am I to perish
like the beasts of the field? or am I to exist in another state of
being? These are questions which now present themselves to my
mind, with an air of solemn majesty, which they never before assumed;
but to whom can I propose them, with any hope of obtaining
a satisfactory reply? There is no voice which speaks, but that
which comes from the excellent glory; and that voice tells me, that
this mortal shall put on immortality; that death shall be swallowed
up in victory; and it teaches me to offer my thanksgivings to God,
who hath given me the victory over the fear of death, and the terror
of the grave, through our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"The language," observed Mr. Stevens, "which our Lord addressed
to his disciples, just before his departure, to assuage the
violence of their grief, is no less calculated to afford us consolation
under our sufferings, especially when we are brought near the verge
of eternity:&mdash;'Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God,
believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it
were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do believe in Him," replied the Rector, "and enjoy the influence
of that belief, in the calm placidity of my mind. I do believe
that he is preparing a place for me amongst the mansions of the
blessed, and I enjoy the influence of that belief in the sublime anticipations
of hope. Yes, I shall soon see him in all the glory of his
majesty, and in all the tenderness of his compassion; and with the
rest of the redeemed I shall soon bow down in his presence with
mingled emotions of astonishment and delight! With astonishment,
that he ever condescended to love me, and to employ me in his
service; and with delight, at the scenes which I shall then behold,
and the voices which I shall then hear. Then shall I be satisfied
when I am assimilated to the Divine likeness."</p>

<p>"You have then no doubt of your final salvation?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir; I wait for it as an event of absolute certainty."</p>

<p>"I perceive," rejoined Mr. Stevens, "that you now make no reference
to the opinion which you have so often expressed respecting
the 'different degrees of glory which the righteous will have conferred
on them in the heavenly world.'"</p>

<p>"I am too deeply anxious on the more important point of getting
into heaven, to bestow even a moment's consideration on the degree
of my future happiness. I know I shall have infinitely more than
I deserve; even if I should have less than the least of all saints;
and I am perfectly willing to take what portion my Lord may assign
me, under a full conviction that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The man who dwells where Jesus is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be completely blest.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I once heard you say," remarked Mrs. Stevens, "that you had
no doubt but we should know each other in the heavenly world.
Have you, Sir, on more mature deliberation, been induced to change
that opinion?"</p>

<p>"No, Madam. When I enter heaven, I shall not forget that I
was once an inhabitant of earth&mdash;that I once lived in a state of rebellion
against God&mdash;that he was pleased to bring me to repentance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;that he employed me in the
ministry, and assigned to me the parish of Broadhurst as the scene
of my labours&mdash;that I associated in the days of my pilgrimage, with
you and your husband, your nephew and his wife, and other Christian
friends&mdash;and that in the exercise of social communion I once
enjoyed some tokens of the Divine favour. If then we shall retain
a distinct recollection of places and occurrences connected with our
earthly sojourn, we shall surely not forget the persons who gave to
those places and occurrences their chief interest and importance.
Suppose I should now, while you are sitting by my side, steal out of
life, and enter heaven, should I on my passage lose a remembrance
of the room in which I expired, or the events which have transpired
this day? Impossible! And could I remember these things, without
remembering you and my other pious friends? And when you
arrive, and are presented faultless, will you not be presented faultless
in the individuality of your person, with all <em>your</em> remembrances
of places, of persons, and events fresh upon you? And will it be
possible for us to associate with each other without making some
reference to the former state of our existence, which will necessarily
lead to a discovery of who we are, and from whence we came, even
if there should be no more direct method of gaining a knowledge of
each other? But apart from this general reasoning, we may appeal
to the Scriptures, which, I think, give their decided sanction to
these views. Hence we find the apostle, when writing to the Thessalonians,
who had through his instrumentality been converted to
the faith of Christ, says, 'For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of
rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus
Christ at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy.' I cannot
affix any meaning to this passage, unless I believe, that each apostle,
and every minister in every succeeding age of the church, will
know the persons who have been converted to God through their
instrumentality; and that from this knowledge will arise some peculiar
degree of glory and of joy."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir," said Mr. Lewellin, "doubtless you can now anticipate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
a high degree of felicity from this source, as God has been
pleased to make your ministry very useful?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt but I shall partake of this source of happiness;
but I am not now anticipating it. My mind is too deeply
occupied by the important question of getting into heaven, to bestow
one solitary thought on the minor questions of our speculative belief.
I am nearing the borders of the holy land of promise; living
now in the anticipation of soon seeing the King in his beauty, and
of undergoing that transformation which I shall feel when I see
him."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, you think you will 'shortly put off this tabernacle,'
and enter that 'house which is not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens?'"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Lewellin; and I can put it off with as much composure
as I can throw aside a worn-out surplice. The time of my departure
is near."</p>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Lewellin, "what shall we do when you are taken
from us? We shall be like the sheep, when the shepherd is gone!"</p>

<p>"No, my dear friend, the great Shepherd may pitch another fold,
and lead you to another pasturage; but he will still 'feed his flock;
he will gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom,
and will gently lead those that are with young.'"</p>

<p>His friends now left him to repose. He slept through the greater
part of the night, but towards the morning became very restless&mdash;often
complaining of a strange sensation in his head. He took a
light breakfast, and as he felt rather drowsy, requested that he
might not be disturbed. About noon he awoke; but felt no disposition
to rise. He again took a little nourishment, and again fell
asleep, and slept till near five o'clock. When he awoke he asked the
hour, but he paid no attention to the reply which was made to him.
His physician now gave it as his decided opinion that he would not
live through the night. "He is in no pain; and if I judge from
the state of his pulse, I should suppose that his life will gradually
depart from him; perhaps when he is asleep." But about seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
o'clock he suddenly revived, sat up in his bed, and requested to have
his hands and his face washed. When this office of kindness was
performed for him, by Mrs. Lewellin, he looked on her for some
moments without uttering a word; and then stretching out his
hand he said, "My dear, I thank you. You have not anointed me
against my burial; but you have refreshed me to encounter the last
enemy. Death is upon me, but he does not come in a terrific form.
No; he is changed from the king of terrors into an angel of deliverance.
I will thank you, Sir," addressing himself to Mr. Lewellin,
"to read the eighth chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and
then pray for me; and pray that I may be favoured with a sense of
the Divine presence when passing through the valley of the shadow
of death." Mr. Lewellin having complied with his wishes, the
venerable pastor then gave his friends his blessing; exhorting them
to cleave to the Lord with full purpose of heart. After remaining
silent for some minutes, during which time he appeared to be in
the solemn act of commending his soul to God, he looked round
with great benignity of countenance, and said, "Why, my children,
do you weep?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible, Sir," Mrs. Lewellin replied, "for us to lose such
a pastor and such a friend without weeping?"</p>

<p>"Well, I will forgive your tears, because I know you love me;
but I cannot weep with you. Though I have not before me that
scene of martyrdom which presented itself to the great apostle of
the Gentiles, when addressing his son Timothy, yet I can adopt
the triumphant language which he then uttered, and with an equal
degree of confidence:&mdash;'I am now ready to be offered, and the time
of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have
finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid
up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all
them also that love his appearing.'" And having uttered these
words he reclined his head on his pillow, and gently breathed his
last.</p>

<h2>THE RECTOR'S FUNERAL.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_560.jpg" alt="U" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Upon the report of the pastor's death being spread
through the village, a sudden shock was felt by almost
every one, though the event itself did not excite much
surprise. He had lived so long amongst his parishioners,
and had endeared himself to them by so many acts of kindness,
that they wept for him, as an affectionate child mourns for the
loss of his father; and even the worldly and indifferent concurred
in paying a just tribute of respect to his memory. On the day of
his funeral, an immense concourse of people assembled. The instructions
which he had given to his friend, Mr. Stevens, respecting
his funeral, were minutely attended to; and they were in strict
accordance with the chaste simplicity of character which he had
maintained through life. There was no hearse with its nodding
plumes&mdash;no hired mourners; he had selected twelve of the senior
members of his church to carry his body to the tomb, and fixed on
the spot where the bier was to rest while they relieved each other
from the fatigue of carrying his mortal remains. The procession
moved from the rectory about ten o'clock in the morning, preceded
by the Rev. Mr. Guion and two other clergymen&mdash;followed by a few
of his relations and a long train of friends, walking three a-breast,
in deep mourning&mdash;many of his poorer parishioners, having only a
piece of crape on their hats, fell into the rear, which was closed by
the children of the Sunday-school, who wore a similar badge of grief.
Immediately as the procession began to move, the bell, which had
been tolling for more than an hour, ceased till the bier stopped at
the appointed resting-place, when it again commenced to send forth
its melancholy sounds.</p>
</div>

<p>On entering the churchyard, the Rev. Mr. Guion began the solemn
service by repeating the animating words of Jesus Christ&mdash;"I am
the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
were dead, yet shall he live." The coffin was taken into the church,
and placed on an elevated platform before the pulpit, so as to be
distinctly seen by the whole congregation; and after a few minutes,
during which time the people were taking their seats, Mr. Guion
began reading, in a most solemn and impressive manner, the lessons
which are appointed for such an occasion. Agreeably to the custom
at funeral obsequies in former times, after he had finished the two
lessons, he ascended the pulpit, and delivered a discourse from the
following appropriate text&mdash;"Sorrowing most of all for the words
which he spake, that they should see his face no more" (Acts xx. 38).
After a short and judicious introduction, he called attention to the
following remarks, which he illustrated and enforced with great
effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The decease of a minister is an event of great importance&mdash;</p>

<p>"I. In relation to himself. No class of men occupy a station so
important, or are called to discharge duties so momentous, as ministers
of the gospel. The eloquent advocate who pleads at the bar,
sometimes snatches the victim from the altar, against whose life the
foul conspirator has brought his charge, and he retires from the
scene of his labours amidst the plaudits of the people; but in a few
years they both sink into the same silent earth, and a remote posterity
remains ignorant of their anxieties and of their triumphs.
The fearless senator attacks iniquity in the high places of its dominion,
or rouses up the slumbering principle of justice to vindicate
her insulted honours; but he sleeps with his fathers, and having
received the honour of his country's applause he is conveyed to the
mansions of the dead. The effects of their labours terminate with
the occasion of their exercise; or if they should stretch into a distant
futurity, they are circumscribed within the boundaries of time.
From man they receive their commission, and to man they resign
it when it is executed; and though their conduct will undergo a
revision at the day of judgment, yet it is from man they receive
their official discharge. But it is not so with us. It is true that
we are under some degree of responsibility to our superiors in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
ecclesiastical hierarchy, and it is equally true that we are under
some degree of responsibility to the people of our cure; but our chief
responsibility relates to a higher tribunal, and a more important
decision awaits us than any which man can pronounce. Fix your
attention for a moment on a minister of the gospel, see him tottering
on the brink of eternity&mdash;he falls, we catch his descending
mantle, 'sorrowing most of all that we shall see his face no more;
but while we are making preparations to perform his funeral obsequies,
he is giving up an account of his stewardship. Then the
motives which induced him to enter the ministerial office, and which
induced him to continue it&mdash;the manner in which he spent his time,
and discharged the hallowed duties devolving on him&mdash;will undergo
a strict investigation, and the final sentence will be pronounced,
which will fix his doom in raptures or in woe, for ever. If he be
found faithful, he will receive the commendation of his Master; but
if unfaithful, he will be cast into outer darkness, 'where their worm
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.'</p>

<p>"It is an event of importance in relation&mdash;</p>

<p>"II. To the people of his charge. They lose their spiritual teacher,
their counsellor, their friend, and their example. Yes! and some
of you who are now looking on that coffin, if permitted to give utterance
to your sentiments, would say, 'There lies the holy man of
God, who met me in my mad career of folly and of crime, and was
the means of turning my feet into the way of peace.' 'There he
lies,' another could say, 'who, when I was perishing for thirst,
opened my eyes, and showed me the well of living waters.' 'Alas!'
another would exclaim, 'I shall now see his face no more; who,
when I was sinking into despair, under the virulence of my moral
malady, told me of the balm of Gilead, and of the great Physician
there, who healed and comforted me, giving me renovated health
and a deathless life.' Farewell, holy man of God; we shall see thy
face no more, till we see thee the express image of thy Lord's person.</p>

<p>"It is an event of importance in relation&mdash;</p>

<p>"III. To general society. No man, saith the apostle, liveth to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
While we are individually pursuing our separate interests, we
are advancing the general good, and not unfrequently serve others,
while intent only on serving ourselves. If this be true of men
in general, it is more emphatically true in relation to the ministers
of the gospel. While they are discharging the functions of
their office in relation to the people of their charge, they are diffusing
principles abroad in society which will be found to operate more
widely than is generally imagined. When they die, the influence
of their example, of their character, of their precepts, of their individual
exertions to promote private happiness, and to support public
institutions&mdash;and of their prayers&mdash;is a loss which is felt not only
in the immediate circle in which they moved, but to a much larger
extent; though it may not be felt so instantaneously nor so deeply.</p>

<p>"But, my brethren, it is not in my power to calculate the loss
which you have sustained by the decease of the venerated man
whose corpse is now before us; and who, for more than forty years,
has preached the gospel of peace in this pulpit.</p>

<p>"When he first entered on the duties of his office, he found a barren
wilderness; but he has left a fruitful field. The church, which was
mouldering to ruins, he repaired and enlarged; the congregation,
which was scattered, he has gathered together; and many who have
preceded him through the dark valley, and many whom he has left
to follow him, he has been the means of saving from the impending
wrath of the Almighty. It is now many years since the person
who is now addressing you went, under the most unfavourable impressions,
to hear him preach; but the word that fell from his lips
came with power, and I, who went to scoff, returned to pray. From
that hour I revered him as my spiritual father in Christ; and an
intimacy soon after commenced, which continued unbroken and undisturbed
till death. If I were now to give full scope to my feelings,
I should probably be censured by some for pronouncing an extravagant
eulogy on his character; but I am conscious that while he owed
all his excellence to the renewing and purifying influence of Divine
grace, he uniformly displayed, both in public and in private life, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
degree of excellence which has been rarely surpassed, if equalled, in
modern times. As a preacher, he excelled no less in the descriptive
than in the argumentative style of his address&mdash;combining in all
his discourses strength of reasoning with the most happy modes of
illustration&mdash;equally capable of awing his congregation by the solemnity
of his manner, and subduing them by the tenderness of his
appeals; compelling them by the ardour of his feelings, and energy
of his utterance, to lose sight of the messenger who was speaking,
in a devout contemplation of the message which he delivered; and
giving to things unseen such a power of impression, that those
which are visible seemed to dwindle into a state of absolute insignificancy.</p>

<p>"As a man, he was courteous in manners, and amiable in disposition;
as a friend, he was disinterested and faithful in his attachments;
as a Christian, he was devout and catholic in his spirit;
as a minister, he was independent, yet attentive and affectionate&mdash;uniformly
endeavouring to incorporate in his character the moral
qualities which his Lord and Master developed in the progress of
his history; and though a nice observer might discover a few shades
of imperfection falling on it, yet they were scarcely perceptible. He
approached the nearest to the perfect man of the Scriptures of any
one I ever knew; but that which gave a distinctive peculiarity to
his character, and which made him the object of general esteem and
veneration, was his catholic liberality, his ever-active benevolence,
and his amiability&mdash;combined with a chastened seriousness and
sportive playfulness of disposition, which exhibited the gravity of
religion untinged by the gloom of superstition, and its cheerfulness
free from the levity of folly.</p>

<p>"He thought and judged for himself on every part of revealed
truth, and maintained the doctrines which he held with the most
determined firmness; yet he never suffered his mind to be soured by
the spirit of controversy, nor was he ever known to treat those who
differed from him with contempt or with indifference. He loved the
catholic spirit of the gospel, no less than its sublime doctrines; uniformly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
condemned that arrogance of spirit which leads the bigot to
say of the members of his own communion, 'The temple of the Lord!
the temple of the Lord are we!' and demonstrated by his conduct
that he was as anxious to preserve the bonds of peace unbroken
amongst the different denominations of Christians as to keep the
unity of the faith entire. And while he gave a decided preference
to the Church of which he was so bright an ornament, yet he felt a
deep interest in the prosperity of every other religious community
which contends earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to
the saints; and admitted to his friendship and intimacy the pious
Dissenter, with as much cordiality as he embraced an Episcopal
brother.</p>

<p>"But his catholic liberality did not degenerate into latitudinarianism.
He was willing to cultivate Christian fellowship with all who
love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and was anxious to narrow
rather than widen the ground of difference between them; but he
felt no inclination to compromise any essential doctrines of the gospel
as a compliment to the semi-sceptical spirit of the age&mdash;choosing
rather to run the risk of incurring the charge of bigotry, than sanction
a popular opinion that there is no danger in speculative error,
if the person who imbibes it be sincere in his belief, and display an
exterior amiability of temper and conduct, in accordance with the
laws of practical righteousness. His charity was not of that deceptive
cast, which places a human being who rejects the leading doctrines
of Christianity on a level, in the Divine estimation, with the
humble disciple of Jesus Christ who implicitly receives them, as he
was convinced 'that the charity which the Scriptures so earnestly
inculcate, consists in a real solicitude for the welfare of others, not
in thinking well of their state;' and thus, while he gave ample
scope for the exercise of his compassion in aiming to promote the
salvation of all his hearers, he felt awed by that authority which
separates the believer from the unbeliever, and which marks, by a
palpable line of distinction, the essential difference between those
who admit, and those who deny the truth as it is in Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some men are benevolent, but the principle of their benevolence
lies embedded in their mental constitution, like fire in the flint, and
it is only by hard and reiterated strokes that it can be elicited. This
principle, when exerted, may produce all the effects of a spontaneous
flow of feeling; but it looks so much like that sullen selfishness
which is absorbed in its own gratifications, that its occasional exertions
are regarded only as a novel tribute to its own capricious
taste.</p>

<p>"Others are benevolent, but the principle of their benevolence is
associated with so much finesse and self-adulation, and with so
many disgusting and offensive requirements, that while it relieves
the wants of a sufferer, it inflicts a deep wound on his spirit, and
makes him feel such an oppressive weight of obligation, that he
cannot enjoy the comforts which have been administered to him.
But the benevolence of our deceased friend was the master-passion
of his soul, and it was ever wakeful&mdash;ever active; which required
no qualifications for its exercise, but misery in some of her multiplied
forms; it prescribed no bounds for its exertions, but the limits
of his own means; and he bestowed his bounties with so much delicacy,
that no other emotion was ever excited in the breast of the
recipient than that of the purest gratitude to his kind benefactor.</p>

<p>"His kindness of disposition led him to feel great tenderness for
the reputation of others; and though no one could reprove vice more
keenly, yet he never sanctioned that habit of depreciating the character
of absent individuals, which may be regarded as one of the
most besetting sins of human nature. Hence, few men possessed
more friends, or fewer enemies; it may be doubted whether among
the numerous list of the former he lost the esteem of one.</p>

<p>"Perhaps no man ever united more closely in his private character
the dignity and the cheerfulness of religion&mdash;preserving unimpaired
the sanctity of his station with a lively and playful disposition;
and maintaining the reputation of a holy man of God,
while hailed in general society as the amiable, the intelligent, and
the interesting companion. The line which separates the harmless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
from the pernicious he was never known to pass, so that he never
injured the sanctity of his public character by any levities in his
demeanour, but inspired a greater reverence for it, by the dignified
ease of his manners, and the uniform placidity and agreeableness of
his temper.</p>

<p>"The closing scene of his life was no less beautiful than impressive;
and forces from us the exclamation of the worthless prophet, 'Let me
die the death of the righteous! and let my last end be like his!' He
is gone! That face on which you have looked with so much pleasure,
you will see no more; that voice to which you have so often listened
with mingled emotions of awe and pleasure, you will hear no more,
till you meet him before the judgment-seat of the Son of God; and,
brethren, permit me to ask you, whether you think you are prepared
to see him, and hear him there? He has preached to you the gospel
of peace, with great fidelity, and with equal affection; but have you
received it, not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word
of God? He has watched for your souls as one who knew that he
must give an account; but have you, by your submission to the
truth which he proclaimed, enabled him to do it with joy and not
with grief? Is there no one in this congregation who has remained
insensible to his moral danger, though that danger has often been
pointed out to you in the most awful and impressive manner? Is
there no one who has remained impenitent, notwithstanding the
various efforts which the venerated deceased employed to bring you
to repentance, and to a belief of the truth? Is there no one who has
forced the aged pastor to retire from this pulpit to his study, and
there to weep and to mourn, and to say, in the bitterness of his
mental agony, 'When I speak they will not hear: but put from them
the words of life, and the way of peace they will not know?' He is
gone to enjoy the reward of his labours, and ere long you, my
brethren, will follow him. But are you prepared to give an account
of the manner in which you have improved his faithful services
amongst you? If you are, you will again meet and again intermingle
your social feelings and affections in a world where you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
enjoy an endless duration of bliss; but if not, let me beseech you to
retire, and on your knees implore mercy and forgiveness, lest you
should be taken off in the midst of your sins, and be cast out with
the workers of darkness, where there will be weeping, and wailing,
and gnashing of teeth for ever."</p>

<p>When this discourse was finished, the corpse was removed to the
vault; and when placed in it, the remaining part of the Burial
Service was read. When the earth fell on the lid of the coffin, as
the impressive words, <em>ashes to ashes, dust to dust</em>, were uttered, there
was a spontaneous burst of audible weeping from the whole assemblage,
which, for a few moments, so overpowered the feelings of Mr.
Guion, that it was with some degree of difficulty he could proceed.
At length the service was concluded; but on returning from the
church the order of the procession was deranged, for while some few
walked back to the rectory, others pressed round the tomb; and
many stood about the churchyard in detached groups, recalling the
various incidents in their history connected with their deceased
pastor. "O!" said one athletic youth, who wept while he spoke, "I
was a bold transgressor till I heard him preach." "I went to laugh,"
said another, "but I returned to pray." "He was my friend," said
many voices; and all expressed their opinion that they should never
see a successor equal to him.</p>

<p>After the concourse of people had dispersed, Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin
continued wandering amongst the tombs, reading the epitaphs
which surviving friendship had engraven on the head-stones of their
departed relatives and friends. The place of sepulture in which they
were now walking, was one of the neatest of rural burying places.
The walks were free from weeds; there were no gaps in the hedges;
the graves bore no marks of being trodden by the foot of beast or
of man; the yew trees luxuriated in their native growth, without
assuming those fantastic shapes and forms which a capricious taste
sometimes compels them to take, and the green ivy overspread the
walls of the venerable church. Many of the inscriptions on the earlier
tombstones were nearly effaced, and those which were still legible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
like too many of the "good old times," recorded sentiments and expressions
which are no less offensive to a refined taste, than to a
scriptural faith. But in the later stones, which had been erected
during the lifetime of the venerable pastor, a striking difference
was observable. The inscription bore the name and the age of
the occupant of the tomb, and beneath it some appropriate text of
Scripture&mdash;recalling the words of an elegant writer, "It is meet,
pleasant, and soothing to the pious mind, when bereaved of friends,
to commemorate them on earth by some touching expression taken
from that book which reveals to them a life in heaven."</p>

<p>Mr. Lewellin and his wife now entered the church, resolving to go
and indulge their solemn meditations beside the uncovered tomb of
the deceased pastor; but on passing down the aisle, were suddenly
startled by the deep sounds of sorrow. On looking towards the
vault where Mr. Ingleby's remains were deposited, they saw an aged
couple leaning on their staffs, looking into the grave, but they appeared
too much oppressed by grief to give any other vent to their
feelings than by sighs and tears. "Come, Dame, let us be gone,"
said the old man to his wife; "it won't be long before we see him
again." As they turned round from the grave, Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin
advanced and kindly endeavoured to mitigate their sorrow.
"O! Sir," said the old man, "he was a good man, and a faithful
minister of Christ; and many will have to bless God for ever, for
sending him amongst us. We thought we loved him while he was
with us; but we did not know that we loved him so much till he
was taken away. But it won't be long before we shall see him
again." "Then," said Mr. Lewellin, "I presume you have received
the gospel which he preached amongst you, not as 'the word of man,
but, as it is in truth, the word of God.'" "Yes, Sir, we have been
enabled to receive it. Before he came to preach in this village we
very seldom attended church, and never thought about the salvation
of our souls; but, blessed be the name of the Lord, we were
both called to the knowledge of the truth through the instrumentality
of his honoured servant; and have, for the space of near forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
years, been walking together as heirs of the grace of life. It was a
great shock to our feelings when we heard of his death, though we
expected it; but now he is gone, it is our duty to be resigned to
the will of God. But, Sir, resignation may feel its loss; and the
Saviour won't condemn us if we weep at the grave of our departed
pastor, as He once wept at the grave of Lazarus. He was one of
the most excellent of the earth. He preached well, and he confirmed
the truth which he preached by the unblameableness of his
life. He was a most benevolent man. He obeyed the words of the
Scriptures, and did good to all, especially to the household of faith.
We shall never see his like again."</p>

<p>My friend and his wife felt so deeply interested by the affection
and piety of this aged couple, that they walked with them to their
little thatched cottage. "This little cottage," said the old man,
"was built for us by our pastor, who gave it to us for our life. This
is the chair in which he used to sit, and this is the Bible which he
gave us, and here is his picture, which we have had for these thirty
years&mdash;and this is his walking-stick, that he gave me when I took
my leave of him at the door of the rectory, the Sabbath before he
left us." "And when," said the old woman, "I could not see to
read my Bible, he gave me these spectacles; and he used to come,
and sit with us, and talk to us of Him who lived and died for sinners,
and made us forget the trials of the way, by discoursing to us
about the joys of the end of it. But it won't be long before we see
him again."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin were much affected by this touching account
of their old friend, whose charity and benevolence formed a
theme of grateful remembrance in the minds of those poor cottagers.
Perceiving that their circumstances were much straitened, they presented
them with a trifling sum, and then, amid the blessings of the
aged couple, took leave and proceeded on their way to Rockhill.</p>

<h2>THE NEW RECTORS.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_571.jpg" alt="S" width="100" height="105" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">Soon after the death of the venerable Ingleby, the Rev.
Mr. Cole, the Rector of the adjoining parish of Aston,
whose health had been gradually declining, was taken
very ill. He had accompanied several of his friends to
a concert in a neighbouring town, and on his return caught a violent
cold. No danger was apprehended for several weeks; but having
imprudently accepted an invitation to spend an evening at a friend's,
where he was detained to a late hour at whist, his favourite amusement,
his indisposition gained a fresh accession of strength by exposure
to the night air. He now began to entertain apprehensions
of a fatal termination to his complaint, and said to his wife, when
she was consulting him on the propriety of putting off a party which
had been fixed for the following week, "My dear, I shall never
appear amongst you again."</p>
</div>

<p>"Don't say so, Edward. You are getting low-spirited and unnecessarily
anxious. You should keep up your spirits, and anticipate
the pleasure which you will yet enjoy amongst your friends."</p>

<p>"I have no <em>wish</em> to die, Emily, but I <em>must</em> die. The doctors can
do nothing for me. I should like to see my old friends again, but I
have no spirit to entertain them."</p>

<p>"I heard Dr. Bailey say, that he placed great dependence on the
prescription which he gave to Mr. Russel. Indeed, I think you
look better. He says he has no doubt but you will recover; and all
your friends say that you must banish the thought of dying, as
nothing will tend so much to accelerate that awful event. I think
they had better come: they will put new life into you."</p>

<p>"Yes, they may tell me to banish the thought of dying, but I
cannot do it; it forces itself upon me in spite of all my resolutions
to avoid it."</p>

<p>"Dr. Bailey suggested to me to read some amusing book to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
Here are the <cite>Pickwick Papers</cite>. Let me read you a chapter about
Pickwick and Sam Weller. I know how they used to make you
laugh; and a hearty laugh, to my mind, does more good than all the
medicine in the world."</p>

<p>"Neither Mr. Pickwick nor Sam Weller, my dear, would be proper
companions for me just now. I must pay respect to the sanctity of
my character. I should not object, if I get a little better, to your
reading me the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>, or a paper from the <cite>Spectator</cite> or
<em>Rambler</em>. But I fear my disease has gone too far to be checked by
any human expedient. I must yield to the law of nature, and prepare
for death; and it is, I assure you, an awful thing to die&mdash;to go
from one world to another."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," replied his wife, "as you have long since made
your peace with God, you have nothing to fear; and therefore I
hope you will keep your mind composed."</p>

<p>"My mind is tolerably composed, Emily, except when delirious
thoughts come and throw it into a tumultuous agitation, and then
I feel wandering about in a maze of confusion. Death may be looked
upon by some, who have no taste for earthly enjoyments, with peculiar
interest, as the forerunner of their future bliss; but I would
rather live than die."</p>

<p>When Mr. Cole found himself getting worse, and his most sanguine
friends began to fear that the hour of his departure was at
hand, he wished to receive the sacrament; and the Rev. Dr. Greig,
from a neighbouring town, was requested to come and administer it
to him. The Doctor seemed much affected when introduced to his
old friend; and, after gently squeezing his hand, as a token of affection,
he sat down by his bedside.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Sir," said the reverend Doctor, "to find you so extremely
ill; but I hope you will yet recover."</p>

<p>"That, I fear, is impossible; I must die; and I wish, before I die,
to receive the holy sacrament. I think it will put strength into my
soul, and enable me to meet death without dread."</p>

<p>"I hope you have no dread of death."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no, Doctor, I have no dread of death; but as it is the passage
into the eternal world, I feel that it is an awful thing to die&mdash;more
awful at the crisis than in anticipation."</p>

<p>"It may be awful to the wicked, but it cannot be to you, who
have spent your life in the public service of our Church, promoting
the cause of virtue and religion."</p>

<p>"I confess, Sir, that I have nothing to reproach myself with. I
have spent a long life in the service of our Church, and have
endeavoured to teach my parishioners the way to heaven; and as a
recompense for my well-meant efforts I hope eternal life will be given
to me; but now that death is near, I feel it to be a more awful thing
to die than when I viewed it at a distance. I now see the propriety
of the passage in our Burial Service&mdash;'O God, most mighty, O holy
and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge, eternal, suffer us
not at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.'"</p>

<p>Dr. Greig now proceeded to read the Communion Service; and
having partaken of the elements himself, and given them to Mrs.
Cole and the nurse, he presented them to his dying friend, who ate
the bread, and drank the wine, with great solemnity of manner.
The service being ended, he said that he had one more request to
make, and then he should die in peace. "I wish, Doctor, you would
read the Burial Service at my interment, and preach my funeral
sermon on the following Sunday; and you may tell my parishioners,
that I <em>die in charity with all mankind</em>."</p>

<p>In about six hours after his friend left him, a change took place,
and he remained insensible the greater part of the night. Towards
the morning he awoke out of a deep sleep; and, having taken a little
refreshment, he sat very composedly for a few minutes. Looking at
his wife with intense earnestness, he said, "My dear Emily, I suppose
I must die;" and then he fell back on his pillow, heaved a deep sigh,
and expired. On the seventh day after his death he was buried
in a vault, near the communion table of his own church; and Dr.
Greig, according to his request, read the service, and delivered his
funeral discourse on the following Sabbath. The congregation, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
was unusually large, appeared deeply affected, especially when the
Doctor pointed to the tomb in which their deceased pastor had just
been interred.</p>

<p>In delineating the character or Mr. Cole, Dr. Greig dwelt for some
time on his classical taste and his literary acquirements; paid a
just tribute of praise to his amiable disposition and obliging manners,
and commended him for his uniform attachment to the Church,
of which he had been a minister for the greater part of half a century;
and concluded by saying, "His religion was not of that austere
cast which prohibits the innocent amusements and gratifications
of society, and dooms its possessor to a life of perpetual gloom and
mortification. It was an enlightened piety&mdash;a piety which united
the gravity of wisdom with a cheerful and facetious spirit, which
courted no popularity by the vanity of its pretensions; which sought
retirement rather than publicity; and conciliated the favour of the
Almighty by the practice of virtue, rather than by the dogmas of
belief. His life is an epitome of moral virtue and social goodness,
which may be read by all men with great profit. It will teach us all,
and especially the clergy of our Church, how they should live, and
what recompense they may expect to receive when called to die, as a
reward for their fidelity to their charge. He did not, as we all
know, in imitation of the example of some, rob other churches to fill
his own; but was contented to preach to the select few who favoured
him with their presence and their friendship; and who, I doubt
not, will revere his memory as long as the power of recollection
remains; and who, when the duties of life are discharged, will go
where he is gone, to renew the intimacy of friendship, and enjoy
the felicity of social converse. And who is not struck with the dignified
serenity of his death! There were no raptures of enthusiasm
in prospect of dissolution; no flights of fancy; no rhapsodies of expression,
as though he were weary of life and longed to lose it; but
a submission to the law of nature, which requires that we must die,
accompanied by a sublime avowal which he wished me to make to
you, <em>that he died in charity with all mankind</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>In examining the character of these two clergymen, and reviewing
the temper of mind which they displayed in the immediate prospect
of entering the eternal world, the intelligent reader will perceive a
manifest difference; and though it does not become us to invade the
province of the Supreme Judge, and fix the final destiny of any
human being, yet we may be permitted to say, that the venerable
Ingleby bore the nearest resemblance, in his life and in his death,
to the ministers of the New Testament. If Mr. Cole was the most
learned man, Mr. Ingleby was the most spiritual; and though Mr.
Ingleby derived no gratification from the trifling amusements of
fashionable life, yet he uniformly displayed a cheerfulness of disposition
which became the sanctity of his office. Mr. Cole consented to
die because he could not live; while Mr. Ingleby yielded up his life
as a free-will offering to God who first gave it, and then demanded
it. In the death of Mr. Cole we can discover no humility on account
of the imperfections of his character&mdash;no utterances of a mind delighting
in communion with the great Supreme&mdash;no reference to a
Mediator, by whom the guilty and the worthless are reconciled to
the offended Sovereign&mdash;no ardent anticipations of a state of changeless
purity and glory; while, in the closing scene of Mr. Ingleby's
life, we behold a spirit, yet inhabiting the tabernacle of earth, springing
forward to meet the great Deliverer&mdash;hailing his approach with
mingled emotions of awe and delight&mdash;giving utterance to the sublimest
conceptions of future bliss, and in language, such as Paul
employed when treading on the narrow isthmus which separates
time from eternity. The death of Mr. Cole was certainly the most
calm; but it was the calm of a stagnant pool, whose waters move
not because they are unaffected by any current; while the death
of Mr. Ingleby resembled the peaceful ripple of the crystal stream,
as it moves tranquilly from its source to swell the waters of the
vast ocean. The one died like a philosopher, over whose mind the
light of evidence produced a belief of the existence of an eternal
world, which, alas! presented no powerful attractions; the other,
like a sinner, redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
meet to possess the inheritance of the saints in light, in comparison
with which the brightest honours of earth pass away as things of
no value.</p>

<p>When the pastor of a Dissenting church is called away from his
flock, to give an account of his stewardship to the great Shepherd
and Bishop of souls, an event occurs in its history which generally
produces a most powerful effect on the minds of the surviving members.
As he, while living, was the pastor of their choice, so, when
dead, they cease not to venerate and esteem his memory. They pay
him, it is true, no superstitious homage. All they show is the feeling
of pure nature, which requires no artificial expedients to express its
affection for the object of its esteem when he is taken away. But
amongst them, while the pastor dies, the ministry lives. They turn
away from his tomb to listen to the voice of his successor; and though
they cannot easily transfer that strong attachment and profound
respect which have been the growth of a long and close intimacy,
yet they receive him in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such
in reputation.</p>

<p>In the choice of a successor they have great advantages over their
Christian brethren who are members of the Establishment. They
are not compelled to receive a pastor, but are left to choose one; and
hence, as is natural, they select one whose religious opinions agree
with their own, whose manner of preaching accords with their own
taste, and whose character is such as corresponds with the sacredness
of his profession. And though a popular election is liable to
some objections, yet, from the mode in which it is generally conducted
amongst them, they are but as the small dust of the balance,
when weighed against the sterling value of the privilege which it
involves and secures. The argument employed by Dissenters in support
of this practice is, in their judgment, quite conclusive. They
say, As we claim the right of choosing the attorney whom we consult
on a point of law&mdash;of choosing our surgeon and physician when
visited by sickness&mdash;of choosing the tutor under whose care we
place our children, we act still more in accordance with the established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
laws of social life, and the most obvious dictates of enlightened
reason, when we exercise the right of choice in relation to the pastor
from whose public ministrations we are to receive the consolations
of the gospel of peace. In this instance, no less than in others, a
preference will be felt; and while we hold all in reputation for their
works' sake, who discharge the sacred duties of the pastoral office with
fidelity, we shall derive a greater gratification, and higher degree of
improvement, from the labours of one for whose manner of preaching
we may feel a decided predilection and regard. When this right
of choice is denied us, we are compelled to receive a minister who
has been appointed over us by the authority of another, and if he
be just such a one as we like, no evil is produced; but suppose he
reject the doctrines which we receive as true, or suppose his style
of preaching be in direct opposition to our taste, or suppose his
moral conduct be not in exact accordance with his profession, what
in such a case ought to be our line of conduct? Can we expect to
become established in our faith, by going where that faith is perpetually
assailed? Can we expect to derive consolation, if we go
where the manner in which the message is offered offends our taste?
Can we expect to venerate the ministry, if the man who holds the
hallowed office display not the same mind which was in Christ Jesus
our Lord? Impossible! We may make the experiment, but it will
not be found productive of the fruits of righteousness and peace;
as the laws of nature forbid us to calculate on gathering grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks after the death of Mr. Ingleby, the living of
Broadhurst was presented to Mr. Porteous, the grandson of a neighbouring
magistrate of the same name,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> who took offence at the first
sermon Mr. Ingleby preached; and though he felt a profound respect
for his private virtues, yet he withdrew from his ministry, and usually
attended that of Mr. Cole. This young man possessed a fine
person, and the graces of a popular and commanding elocution; but
he was gay in his manners, volatile in his disposition, addicted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
the sports of the field, and decidedly opposed to those peculiar doctrines
of the gospel which his predecessor had so long and so faithfully
preached.</p>

<p>As his character was generally known through the parish, the
pious members of the Church were deeply depressed when they
heard that he was appointed to succeed their deceased pastor; but
they prudently resolved to hear him preach, having previously met
on several different occasions to pray that a double portion of the
Spirit of grace might rest upon him. The church was excessively
crowded when he delivered his first discourse, which was founded on
the following text&mdash;"Be not righteous over much."</p>

<p>He read the prayers with so much seriousness and propriety of
emphasis, that the whole congregation was delighted with him.
When he announced his text, there was a simultaneous movement
amongst them; and for a few moments they looked at each other as
though deeply amazed, and then the eyes of all were fastened on
him. After adjusting his position and his attitude with great caution,
and surveying his audience with an appearance of complacency,
he began reading his sermon, which he delivered in fourteen minutes,
and then concluded the service. The sermon was a severe philippic
on the labours of his predecessor, and the piety of his hearers; and
though in the conclusion he paid a passing tribute of respect to his
private virtues, and the benefits which the parish had received from
his pastoral visits, yet he gave it as his decided opinion that he had
uniformly disregarded the <em>important</em> injunction of the text:&mdash;"That
he erred from the purest motives we all must admit; and it must
be some consolation to know, that his error was all on the side of
virtue; but virtue is never so lovely as when she is kept from all
excess of feeling&mdash;as when she spurns from her those restraints,
which, by keeping her out of the circle of <em>innocent</em> indulgences, give
her the appearance of grief-worn sadness&mdash;as when she enjoys life,
and is contented to wait for the reward which the Almighty will
confer on her honest and well-meant endeavours to please him.
That it will be my endeavour to avoid the error into which my most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
excellent predecessor fell, my intelligent hearers may calculate on;
and I flatter myself by so doing, I shall diffuse over the whole of
my parish, the air of cheerful gaiety and social pleasure; and that
the gloom which has so long hung over you will soon disappear, as
the lowering cloud retires from the face of nature, when the bright
orb of day scatters his golden rays in passing from the horizon to
the meridian."</p>

<p>When he had finished his discourse, he paused for the loud Amen;
but the good old clerk disdained to utter it; and when, on retiring
to the vestry, he was asked by Mr. Porteous, the grandsire of the
new Rector, why he had neglected his duty, he honestly replied,
"Because, Sir, I did not choose to sanction those perversions of the
gospel which the Rector has been guilty of this morning; nor appear
to commend the severe and unjust animadversions which he has
made on the character of my deceased pastor."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, you shall be turned out of office."</p>

<p>"I will not wait to be turned out, Sir, I will resign it; for I have
too much love for the truth to sanction error, and hold the reputation
of my deceased pastor in too much esteem to say Amen, after it
has been so wantonly defamed."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, I suppose you intend to raise the standard of revolt
against my grandson; but if that be your mind, you shall suffer
for it."</p>

<p>"As I live, Sir, in a land of freedom, and was never in bondage to
any man, I shall not, now I am grown gray in years, sell my birth-right
for a mess of pottage; and therefore, without wishing to
give either you or the new Rector any offence, I frankly tell you,
that while he continues to preach as he has preached this morning,
I will never return to hear him."</p>

<p>"You are an obstinate fellow, and ought not to be suffered to
speak to your superiors in this style."</p>

<p>"You asked for the reasons of my conduct, which I have given
you; and also for the line of conduct I intend to pursue, and I have
told you; and now, as you descend to abuse, I will retire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>This altercation with the old clerk, who was greatly esteemed by
the congregation for his superior intelligence and decided piety, was
overheard by many of the people, who were much pleased; first, by
his silence at the conclusion of the service, and now, by the bold
stand which he made against the perversion of the truth, and the
unmerited attack on the reputation of the venerable deceased. On
coming out of the vestry, he was commended by them, and urged
not to suffer any threat to induce him to bend to the authority,
which had so unhandsomely endeavoured to intimidate him.</p>

<p>As Mr. Lewellin had acquired a considerable degree of influence
among the pious members of the Church, during the short time he
had resided in the parish, they very naturally looked to him for
counsel at this critical juncture; and though he was unwilling to
take any premature steps, yet he gave it as his decided opinion,
that they ought not to suffer the gospel to be driven from amongst
them. "I am a Dissenter," said he to a few friends who waited on
him; "but while the gospel was preached in the Church, I felt perfectly
willing to worship there, and should have continued to do so,
if the new Rector had followed the example of our deceased pastor,
but as he has chosen to make such a bold avowal of his determination
to extirpate the serious and devout piety of the parish, that he
may propagate his gay and anti-Christian religion, I think we are
called upon by the voice of Providence to prevent it."</p>

<p>"I cannot leave the Church," said one.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said another.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said a third.</p>

<p>"I should not like to leave it," said another, "but if I cannot
hear the gospel in the Church, I will hear it where I can."</p>

<p>It was finally determined to let things take their course for the
next few weeks, during which time they were to consult their friends
on the question.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath after Mr. Porteous preached his first sermon at
Broadhurst, Mr. Hartley, Mr. Cole's successor, took possession of his
living at Aston, and preached his first discourse from Ezek. xxxvii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
3&mdash;"And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
answered, O Lord God, thou knowest." From these words, taken
in connection with the entire parable, he gave a description of the
moral condition of man, during the period of his unregeneracy; demonstrated
the inefficacy of all human expedients to recover him,
without the co-operation of a supernatural power; and traced the
progress of his spiritual renovation by the renewing power of the
Holy Spirit, from its earliest symptoms to its final consummation
in heaven. The sermon discovered some ingenuity, but more judgment;
it abounded with striking remarks, expressed in the most
appropriate language; but its predominating quality was a regular
appeal to the understanding and the heart of the audience, conducted
with such force of reasoning, and charm of persuasion, that
many expressed their astonishment at their former ignorance of
revealed truth; while those who had long enjoyed the ministry of
the venerable Ingleby, rejoiced that God had sent another faithful
messenger amongst them. Some few, who were the late incumbent's
personal friends, and who often participated with him in the
amusements of fashionable life, were displeased with the <em>length</em> of
the sermon, though they were gratified with the chasteness of the
language which was employed; and reprobated the austere requirements
of the new religion, while they spoke in very complimentary
terms of the elegant composition and the good delivery of the new
Rector. The great majority of the people, however, were astonished
and delighted; and from the conclusion of the sermon were led to
anticipate in Mr. Hartley a very different pastor from Mr. Cole.</p>

<p>"Hitherto, many of you have lived," said the preacher, "without
any deep repentance on account of your sins&mdash;without any active
and operative faith in the efficacy of the Saviour's death&mdash;without
enjoying any spiritual communion with the great Invisible&mdash;and
without anticipating your entrance into the eternal world with that
sublime awe which such an event ought to inspire in your breast.
It devolves on me to rouse you from this state of deep insensibility
and criminal impiety. You live; but what is that life which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
have lived? Has it not been a life of social pleasure&mdash;a life of vain
indulgences&mdash;a life of indifference to the interesting facts, the sublime
doctrines, the pure precepts, and the glorious promises of the
gospel of Jesus Christ! It now devolves on me to awaken you, if
possible, out of this mental delusion, that you may 'yield yourselves
unto God as those that are alive from the dead;' then ye 'shall
have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.' To accomplish
this, I shall add private admonition to public instruction;
and though I have no wish to pry into the secrets of your families,
nor to obtrude myself where my presence would not be acceptable,
yet it will be my endeavour, as far as possible, to gain an accurate
knowledge of the spiritual state of the whole of my charge, in the
hope that by God's blessing I may be able at the last day to present
every one of you perfect in Christ Jesus. When you are afflicted,
I will visit you; when in trouble, I will administer to you the consolations
of the gospel; in your dying hours, I shall consider it a
privilege to be permitted to cheer you with the hope of immortality;
and as I am placed over you as your spiritual guide and friend, I
assure you, that there is no sacrifice which I will hesitate to make,
nor any duty which I will not most cheerfully perform, to promote
your happiness; and I shall esteem the gratification of serving you
an adequate recompense for all my exertions, as I seek not yours,
but you."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>A SECESSION AT BROADHURST.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_582.jpg" alt="W" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">When Mr. Hartley took possession of his cure at Aston,
Mr. Stevens immediately declined having public worship
conducted in his chapel any longer. On being
remonstrated with by Mr. Langley, a zealous Dissenter,
for breaking up a society which had been flourishing for many years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
he said, "I dissented, not from choice, but from necessity; but now
I can hear the gospel in the parish church, I think it no less my
duty to return to her communion, than I once felt it my duty to
withdraw from it. The minister who is appointed over us is a good
man; and as the church in which he officiates is large enough to
contain the whole of the population, I see no reason why the people
should be divided, especially as most of them have no conscientious
objections against either the doctrines or the ceremonies of our Episcopal
Establishment."</p>
</div>

<p>"But, Sir," replied Mr. Langley, "though the gospel be now
preached in the church, you are not certain that it will be after the
death or removal of the present incumbent; and then what are the
pious members of the church to do, if you now shut up your chapel?
Would it not be more prudent on your part, to secure the permanent
continuance of the gospel in the parish, by perpetuating its public
ministrations in your chapel, than thus hazard its entire expulsion?
If you adopt this plan, there will be a place of refuge for the piety of
the parish, if at any future time it should be compelled to retire
from the Established church."</p>

<p>"Such a plan, I have no doubt," replied Mr. Stevens, "would meet
with the approbation of many pious Dissenters; but I am not disposed
to adopt it. If, under the ministry of our present Rector, the
people should receive the truth, not as the word of man, but as the
word of God, they will not suffer it to disappear from amongst
them, even if they should be deprived of it in the church; but will
most certainly avail themselves of their rights as British freemen,
and erect for themselves a chapel, in which they may worship God
according to the dictates of their conscience, and enjoy a ministry
of their own choice."</p>

<p>But while the sun of prosperity was shining on the parish of Aston,
dispelling the gloom of ignorance and superstition which had
hovered over it for many years, it was setting on the adjoining
hamlet, which had for a longer time enjoyed the light of truth,
leaving the people in a most disconsolate state. "To lose our old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
pastor," said an old Christian to Mr. Lewellin, "was a great loss;
but to have the candlestick removed from amongst us, and the light
thereof extinguished, is a much greater loss. While we had the
light we rejoiced in it; but I fear that, like the church of Ephesus,
we have lost our first love; and as we have not repented and done
our first works, the Lord has visited us with this grievous judgment."</p>

<p>A few of the more influential members of the Establishment met
at Mr. Lewellin's to consider what plan they ought to adopt on the
present occasion. As they venerated the Church, and felt an ardent
attachment to its forms and ceremonies, they were unwilling to
withdraw from her communion. One gentleman said, he had been
to consult the Rev. Mr. Guion, who gave it as his decided opinion
that they should still attend their parish church, and pray for the
conversion of the new Rector. "If," he said, "you have not the
gospel in the pulpit, you have it in the desk; and though it may not
please God to answer your prayers, yet you will have this compensation
for the sacrifice you will be called upon to make&mdash;that you have
remained faithful to your Church."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to leave the Church," replied another; "but I
must hear the gospel. I am commanded to take heed <em>what I hear</em>;
and if I disobey this injunction, how can I expect to enjoy the Divine
blessing?" In this opinion they all concurred; and as they could
attend the neighbouring church, it was proposed that they should
sit under the ministry of the new Rector at Aston.</p>

<p>"But," said Mr. Lewellin, "though we who have vehicles can
easily go three or four miles on the Sabbath-day, to enjoy a pure
and an enlightened ministry, yet what are the poor and the infirm
to do? They cannot attend; and shall we leave them to spend the
remainder of their days in a state of spiritual destitution? Have
they no claim on our benevolent feelings? Shall we, by deserting
them in this their low estate, allow them to go and utter the mournful
complaint at the footstool of the Divine throne, '<em>No man careth
for our souls</em>?' Shall we provide no spiritual comforter, but suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
them to live and die without having one near them to administer
the consolations of religion? Shall we stand still and see this fine
moral inheritance falling back into its original state of ignorance
and vice; when, by acting that part which our deceased pastor more
than once recommended, we may be the means of preserving it from
decay? Did he not say, in the last sermon he preached to us, that he
hoped the Lord would provide another minister, who would preach
the gospel to us either in the church, <em>or elsewhere</em>? And in a private
conversation, on the evening of his departure, he said, in reply
to a question, 'The great Shepherd <em>may pitch another fold, and lead
you to another pasturage</em>.'"</p>

<p>"If," said a gentleman, "I were to consult my own inclination, I
should still attend with my family at Broadhurst; but I do not
think we should act a generous or a Christian part if we were to
make no effort to establish a gospel ministry in the parish. Cannot
we do what Mr. Stevens did under similar circumstances? and then,
if it should please God at any future time, to favour us with a Rector
who will preach the same doctrines as those which we have been
accustomed to hear, we can return to the Church, and live and die
in her communion. And if not, we shall have this compensation for
the sacrifice which we shall be called to make, that we have acted in
accordance with the wishes of our deceased pastor, and, I trust, in
accordance with the will of our Lord and Master." This suggestion
was eagerly seized by several others; and it was finally determined to
build a neat chapel, large enough to contain about 500 worshippers;
and to obtain the permanent labours of some good minister of Jesus
Christ. As soon as this decision was made known, the pious villagers
expressed their gratitude in the most affecting terms; and offered
to contribute, out of the depths of their poverty, towards the necessary
expenses which would be incurred; but their more wealthy
Christian brethren rather chose to bear the whole burden among
themselves.</p>

<p>One gentleman gave a piece of freehold land, on which the chapel
was erected; and adjoining it, a house for the minister, with a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
garden attached. It was built within the space of six months; and
by the exertions of Mr. Lewellin, Mr. Drew, a pious and intelligent
young man, was appointed to take the pastoral charge of the people.
Being of a catholic spirit, and wishing to render his public ministrations
generally acceptable, he prudently consented to read the
Liturgy of the Church of England. Though, at first, some of the
people sighed, and others wept as they passed by the venerable
building in which for so many years they had worshipped the God
of their fathers, yet in process of time they felt an equal degree of
attachment to this second temple, which, if less imposing in its
appearance, contained the Shechinah of truth, which departed from
the altar when the venerable Ingleby fell asleep in Jesus. Some
years after, in a conversation with the intelligent clerk, who held
the same office in the chapel as he had filled in the church, he informed
me, that his pastor bore a near resemblance to the deceased
Rector, in the amiability of his temper, and in the ardour of his
zeal for the salvation of his hearers, though he differed from him in
the manner and style of his preaching. "The Rector, Sir," he remarked,
"was a son of consolation, from whose lips the words of
mercy fell in soft and subduing accents on the ears of the congregation;
Mr. Drew is a Boanerges, the thunder of whose eloquence
awes us by its majesty; but when he has wrought up our feelings to
the highest degree of terror, he suddenly shifts the scene, and exhibits
to our view the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of
the world. Mr. Ingleby, I think, had the finest imagination, but
Mr. Drew has the most powerful intellect; and though the former
could enter into all the variations of Christian experience with the
greatest ease, yet the latter applies the truth with equal force to the
wounded conscience. Mr. Ingleby was distinguished by the gracefulness
of his manner; Mr. Drew excels in the force and dignity of
his delivery; and though we shall never cease to respect the memory
of our former pastor, we are equally attached to our present. Under
his ministry, no less than under that of his predecessor, many
have been reclaimed from the error of their ways to the wisdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
the just; while the young and the more advanced Christian have
been built up in the faith and the hope of the gospel. The poor are
visited in their cottages; the dying have a spiritual comforter with
them in their last moments; and over the whole parish a moral
vigilance is exercised, which receives the sanction of all the wise
and the good."</p>

<p>After witnessing the changes which a few years had made in the
external establishment of religion in these two parishes, while the
same moral process was going on in the salvation of the people, I
felt how superior, in its nature and tendency, is the spirit of the
gospel to that of religious bigotry. Had Mr. Stevens felt a bigoted
attachment to the principle of dissent, he would have kept open his
chapel after the settlement of Mr. Hartley at Aston, and thus have
divided the people into two distinct societies; while the congregation
at Broadhurst, if they had venerated the church in which the
venerable Ingleby had so long preached, more than the truth which
he delivered, would have been left without an evangelical ministry.
But by acting the part of wisdom and of piety, they perpetuated the
truth in each parish, without occasioning any division amongst those
who were attached to it. Though in one village they sat to hear its
enunciations on unconsecrated ground, while in the other it addressed
them within the walls of the Establishment; yet as it derived none
of its importance or worth from the places in which it is proclaimed,
nor from the ministers who preached it, they mutually received it
with meekness, as the engrafted word which is able to save the soul.
Nor can I doubt that the Saviour visited with equal delight each
congregation which assembled together in his name&mdash;that the Divine
Spirit conveyed the same resistless energy to the Dissenting as to
the Episcopal ministry&mdash;that the angels of heaven hovered over the
village chapel with as much pleasure as over the village church; and
that those who were made meet for glory on unconsecrated ground,
were received with equal rapture by the spirits of the just made
perfect, as their brethren who had worshipped within the pale of
the Establishment. They differed in their relation to the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
forms of Christianity, but possessing its pure and heavenly spirit,
they stood in the same relation to Jesus Christ, who was their
Saviour&mdash;to the Holy Ghost, who was their Comforter&mdash;and to heaven,
which was their undefiled inheritance; and when, at the appointed
time, any of them departed this life, they were neither commended
nor censured for their denominative attachments while on
earth, but admitted into the joy of their Lord as sinners redeemed
by his blood. A friendly intercourse was kept up between the pious
members of the two churches and their respective pastors, which
demonstrated to the villagers that their religion was substantially
the same in its nature and in its design, though it differed in a few
external ceremonies. If they went to church, it was to worship
God&mdash;to confess their sins&mdash;and to hear the glad tidings of salvation;
and if they went to the village chapel, it was to engage in the
same hallowed exercises, and listen to the same gospel of peace. As
they felt no superstitious attachment to the places in which they
assembled, nor imagined that the Episcopal form of ordination gave
to the clergyman a degree of sanctity which the Dissenting minister
did not possess, they intermingled in each other's society, not to
wrangle or contend for superiority, but to cultivate the unity of
their faith, and display the excellence of that grace which "teacheth
us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world." Is it not to
be regretted, that a similar spirit has not been uniformly cherished
amongst the disciples of Jesus Christ? but, alas! they have in general
caught the spirit of the mother of Zebedee's children, rather
than that of their Master, and have been struggling for the ascendency,
instead of living in harmony with each other. And is it not
to this cause, more than any deficiency of evidence, that we may
fairly account for the too general rejection of the gospel; for can we
expect others to believe in its Divine origin, when they see those
who embrace it with the greatest eagerness, displaying an intolerant
temper, and refusing to hold communion with each other because
they happen to differ on a few points of opinion, which they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
acknowledge to be of secondary importance? Every Christian
should examine the following prayer of Jesus Christ, and the reason
which he assigned for presenting it:&mdash;"Neither pray I for these
alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their
word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe
that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I
have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in
them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and
that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved
them, as thou hast loved me" (John xvii. 20-23).</p>

<p>When the spirit of religious bigotry takes possession of the youthful
breast, we naturally feel disposed to attribute it to the immaturity
of the judgment, or a deficiency in Christian principles. We
therefore conclude, that in more advanced life these unamiable qualities
will disappear, and a cordial attachment will be formed for all
of every denomination who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity
and in truth. This, I believe, is generally the case, though we
sometimes see the evil spirit of bigotry souring the temper of aged
Christians, contracting their benevolence, and rendering them more
disposed to live apart from their brethren, than on terms of friendly
intercourse; and if we venture to remonstrate with them, we are
gravely told that they must preserve the consistency of their character.
Consistency! And why not preserve the consistency of
their character as Christians, who are required to love each other as
brethren, rather than the consistency of their character as religious
bigots, who neglect the weightier matters of the law, to cultivate
the mint and cummin of ecclesiastical alienation and intolerance?
Why not, when peculiar circumstances require it, overlook the little
points of difference that exist between them; and unite as those
who are endowed with the same spirit of faith&mdash;who are governed
by the same authority, and who are moving on to the same state of
blessedness and glory?</p>

<p>There were a few Dissenters who could not conscientiously worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
within the walls of the Establishment, even though they revered the
character of the new Rector at Aston, and approved of his ministry.
Not being able to support a society of their own denomination, they
subjected themselves to the inconvenience and expense of travelling
several miles every Sabbath to enjoy the privilege of communion
with their brethren at Broadhurst. But though they could not
unite with their fellow-Christians at Aston in the exercises of public
devotion, they were, nevertheless, zealous in co-operating with
them in the execution of those plans of benevolence which related
to the moral improvement and the temporal advantage of the hamlet
in which they resided. A latitudinarian would be disposed to
censure this unbending spirit in reference to public worship, and
feel himself justified in holding it up to general reprobation; but a
wise man will be sparing of his animadversions on conscientious
scruples, when they are not suffered to disturb the harmony of
friendly intercourse, and do not disqualify those who feel them
from uniting with others of a different faith in the cultivation of
the affections and charities of social life.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Guion, who resided within a few miles of Broadhurst,
and who had been for many years the devoted friend of the
venerable Ingleby, was so much displeased when the pious members
of the congregation seceded from the ministry of Mr. Porteous, that
he broke off all intercourse with them, and not unfrequently expressed
his censures in rather strong language. As they chose,
in opposition to his advice, to withdraw from the pale of the Establishment,
though he knew that their new Rector preached another
gospel than that which they had heard from the lips of their deceased
pastor, he looked upon them as schismatics, with whom he
could not associate, even in the ordinary familiarities of friendship,
without endangering his reputation as a clergyman of the Church
of England. Though he admitted that some moral good might
possibly result from the establishment of a Dissenting ministry in
the village, yet he thought the evil would more than counter-balance
it. He was a good man, but not a perfect man; a zealous minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
of the everlasting gospel, but he wished that gospel to be preached
only within the pale of the Established church; and though in
private life he exhibited many traits of the Christian character,
yet they were rather too strongly marked by the blemishes of a
sectarian spirit.</p>

<p>He occasionally met Mr. Drew, the Dissenting clergyman at Broadhurst,
at the anniversaries of the various Bible Societies in the
country, and also at the houses of Mr. Stevens and Mr. Lewellin. On
these occasions he behaved to him with all the courtesy of a gentleman,
but for a long while he appeared more disposed to shun than
to court his society. He spoke of Mr. Drew in terms of respect,
but not with the warmth of a brotherly affection as one minister of
Jesus Christ should speak of another. On one occasion, having
spoken rather more unguardedly than usual, Miss Ryder, who was
one of his own hearers, with a delicate severity of rebuke, said,
"I presume, Sir, when an angel of the Lord reports to his fellow-angels
that a sinner on earth is brought to repentance, they do not
pause to inquire whether he is a Churchman or a Dissenter before
their rejoicing begins."</p>

<p>"And I suppose," remarked Mrs. Stevens, "when they receive
their appointment to minister to any of the heirs of salvation, they
do not pause in their embassy, contending which shall have the
honour of waiting on a Conformist, in preference to a Nonconformist."</p>

<p>This colloquy was here joined by Mr. Ryder, who was as catholic
in his spirit, as he was decided in his love of the truth. "To me,"
he observed, "the ecclesiastical distinctions between church and dissent,
on which some rest such importance, appear superlatively little
and unimportant, when put in comparison with the essential doctrines
of the common salvation; and the less attention we pay to
them the better is it, I think, for our own peace and Christian consistency.
I am a Churchman in part, because I was educated as
one; and because I can hear the gospel preached by her clergy. If,
however, I were living in a parish where the gospel is disowned, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
it is at Broadhurst, I am sure I should, without a moment's hesitation,
turn a Dissenter, rather than not hear it."</p>

<p>"And so should I," said several voices.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to be able to add, that Mr. Guion's prejudices
gradually subsided, and that in course of time he returned to the
catholic and liberal spirit which he had formerly displayed when
he contributed so generously to the necessities of the Rev. Mr.
Powell.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Though, in the views held by him regarding the great
body of Christians, he never attained to the largeness of heart so
eminently displayed by Mr. Ingleby; he bore, nevertheless, in his
character a strong resemblance to that excellent pastor, and appeared
as his living representative in all that was lovely and of
good report.</p>

<h2>A FAREWELL TO OLD FRIENDS.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_592.jpg" alt="O" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">On quitting Fairmount, to return home, the reader will
recollect that I left Mrs. Orme to remain for a short
time longer at Rockhill, as Mrs. Lewellin felt much depressed
in spirits by her father's death, and required
the presence of a cheerful and affectionate friend to enable her gradually
to dispel her grief, and regain her wonted interest in her
ordinary domestic employments. Mrs. Orme's stay was protracted
much longer than she originally intended, and the close of the year
had nearly arrived before her kind friends would allow her to depart.
During the period of her sojourn at Rockhill, she had gained
many friends, who were attracted as much by the unsophisticated
kindness and liveliness of her disposition as by her painfully interesting
and romantic history. Among others, none formed a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
intimacy than Miss Ryder, who, with her brother, was now a frequent
visitor at Rockhill and Fairmount. Mrs. Orme was invited
to spend a few days at Aston, where she found herself exceedingly
happy in the cheerful society of her new friend Anna, and the
hearty hospitality of her brother, who was led to take a deep interest
in his guest from the fancied resemblance which she bore to
Matilda Denham, the departed object of his youthful affections.
On taking leave of Mr. and Miss Ryder, Mrs. Orme made the
latter promise that she would pay her a visit in the course of the
ensuing summer, at the Elms, as Anna generally went to London
once a-year to visit an elder sister, who had been married and
settled there for some years.</p>
</div>

<p>About two months after Mrs. Orme's departure from Rockhill,
Mr. Ingleby died, as narrated in a foregoing chapter, and was
shortly followed to the grave by Mr. Cole, the Sector of the parish
in which Mr. and Miss Ryder resided. The reader is already aware
of the remarkable religious revolution which now took place in
Aston and the adjoining parish of Broadhurst, though of a very lamentable
description in the latter place. In the course of the same
spring, Mrs. Orme received intelligence of her husband's death, an
event which naturally excited painful emotions in her breast,
though, considering his past conduct, her grief for his loss could
neither be very deep nor poignant. Her little boy was now nearly
two years old, a lovely child both in appearance and disposition, and
an immense favourite with his grandfather, who had insisted on his
mother leaving him at the Elms when she went to visit her friends
in the west of England.</p>

<p>On hearing of Captain Orme's death, Miss Ryder judged it best
to defer her visit to the Elms; and consequently it was not till the
following year that she had again the pleasure of renewing her
friendship with Mrs. Orme, and thus becoming acquainted with the
other members of her family. Nothing could exceed the kind attention
paid her by Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, who felt grateful for the
kindness she had shown to Emma while at Aston. They insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
on her remaining for a considerable period with them, and also that
Mr. Ryder should pay a visit to the Elms, and take his sister home.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Holmes had been much pleased with Miss Ryder,
and also with her brother when he arrived at the Elms. The happy
change, too, in his religious character, which had now taken place,
led to a strong congeniality of feeling in the intercourse between
him and his worthy host and hostess. Many a delightful excursion
was taken by the family in company with their guests; a feeling
of happiness pervaded every member of the household; and for
the first time since the death of Louisa, the family regained their
former liveliness and buoyancy of spirits. It was noticed, however,
that on all occasions Mr. Ryder contrived to secure the company of
Mrs. Orme to himself, both in the family excursions or when at
home at the Elms. Various excuses were invented to favour their
being by themselves, without awakening suspicion, which frequently
excited a smile, and sometimes a good-humoured sarcasm from her
sister Jane.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," said Mrs. Orme, "I left a small needle-case in the
alcove where we were sitting last evening."</p>

<p>"I will run, Emma, and fetch it."</p>

<p>"By no means, dear Jane, I won't trouble you; I can very readily
put my hand upon it."</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder of course accompanied her to the alcove&mdash;a sweet retired
spot; and then they extended their walk to a Roman camp,
at a few miles' distance&mdash;contriving to be back in time to dress for
dinner. On the following morning, Mr. Ryder, knowing that Miss
Jane was under a special engagement to meet an old friend, said at
the breakfast table, "I should like to take an excursion to town
to-day, if you young ladies will accompany me."</p>

<p>"I believe, Sir," said the facetious Jane, with an arch look and
significant nod and smile, "you know that I cannot go, which possibly
may make the excursion the more agreeable."</p>

<p>The carriage was ordered out; the excursion was taken; and an
apology was in readiness to be offered on their return for the lateness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
of the hour. These, and many similar indications of a mutual
attachment, were too obvious to elude the notice of Mr. and Mrs.
Holmes, and therefore it excited no astonishment when Mr. Ryder,
one morning, with Mrs. Orme leaning on his arm, entered Mr.
Holmes' study, and requested his consent to their union. The old
man was so much delighted by this somewhat anticipated request,
that without hesitation, he replied, "I will most cheerfully give it;
and may the Lord bless you." At this moment Mrs. Holmes entered
the room, and joyfully expressed her concurrence in the proposed
match, which had already received the sanction of her husband.</p>

<p>After all the preliminaries were duly adjusted the wedding took
place; and the ceremony was conducted by the Dissenting clergyman
whom Mr. and Mrs. Holmes attended, and whose ministrations had
proved so great a source of consolation to Louisa, on the last occasion
that she was able to go to chapel.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In accordance with the feelings,
however, both of the bride and bridegroom, it was resolved that there
should be no public display or large assemblage of guests, and that
none but the most intimate friends on both sides should be invited.
The marriage was consequently a very quiet proceeding; but though
unattended by the public acclamations which greeted that of Mr.
and Mrs. Lewellin, it was nevertheless quite as happy a one, both at
the time of its celebration and in its results.</p>

<p>On the ceremony being completed, the married couple started
for a tour of a few weeks on the Continent, proceeding by Antwerp
and Brussels to the Rhine, thence passing through Switzerland to
Geneva, and then returning home through France, by Lyons and
Paris. On arriving at Southampton, to which they had crossed from
Dieppe, they proceeded on their journey to the west of England, and
in the course of a day or two arrived at Aston, where Miss Ryder
had everything ready for their reception. And now the reader may
suppose that as I have so satisfactorily disposed of Mrs. Orme, there
remains nothing more to be said of their friends at the Elms; but I
have not yet quite done with the family of the Holmes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>When a professor of religion renounces his faith, and goes off into
the world, we usually see, as in the case of Mr. Beaufoy,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> a most
melancholy change in his character and in his habits. The man of
sobriety often becomes intemperate; the man of unsullied moral character
sometimes becomes a libertine; the habits of domestic virtue
and religion are broken up, and all is desolation and misery. But
when a sceptic embraces the faith of Christ, the moral and social
change is equally conspicuous; and it invariably proves a personal
and a relative blessing. Of this, a striking exemplification occurs in
the history of Mr. Gordon, Mr. Lewellin's early friend. After he
felt the renewing power of the grace of God, the old things of evil,
to which he had long addicted himself, passed away, and he became
a new creature in Christ Jesus&mdash;an essentially different man, in
taste, in principle, and in social habits. He proved the genuineness
of his conversion by the integrity and consistency of his conduct
in all the subsequent stages of his career. In a letter which I received
from him, some months after he had passed from death to life,
he said, "Though I cannot doubt the reality of my spiritual renovation,
and am compelled to ascribe it to the sovereign grace of God,
and though I am persuaded that he will complete what he has
begun, yet I deem it proper to let my principles be fairly tested,
before I make any avowed profession of religion." On this resolution
he acted. The first thing he did, that bore the aspect of attachment
to the Christian faith, was to engage a pew in a church at Blackfriars',
where the gospel was preached in its purity; and he was very
regular in his attendance. And it so happened that his pew adjoined
the one occupied by Mr. William Holmes, the eldest son of my old
friend; who now, along with his brother Edward, carried on the
business from which their father had retired. Young Holmes was
already slightly acquainted with Mr. Gordon, having frequently
heard of him from his sisters. In consequence of their sitting so
near each other in church they frequently walked home together; a
close intimacy sprung up between them, and they often visited at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
each other's houses. The account of Mr. Gordon's miraculous escape,
and the marvellous change of mind and character which immediately
followed, naturally interested young Holmes, and still more
his family, who readily acceded to William's proposal, that the next
time he came to the Elms he should bring his friend with him.
Mr. Gordon was easily prevailed upon to accept the invitation; and
so favourable was the impression made by him on Mr. and Mrs.
Holmes, that he was requested to repeat his visit, and in a short
time became so intimate as gradually to be regarded as one of the
family. Many months had not elapsed before it was evident that a
deep reciprocal attachment had been formed between him and Miss
Jane, which at last terminated in a union, concluded under the happiest
auspices. After their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gordon went to
reside at Blackheath, where a few years afterwards I had the pleasure
of being their guest. They had then three fine children; and
though I have not seen either of them for some time, we still keep
up an occasional correspondence. I am also happy to be able to say
that after his marriage, Mr. Gordon became at once decided in his
profession of religion, endeavouring in all things to adorn the doctrine
of God his Saviour. His natural <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hauteur</i> was exchanged for
the meekness and gentleness of Christ; and he became as zealous in
the defence and diffusion of the faith once delivered to the saints, as
he had been in his hostility against it. He was much esteemed by
his Christian brethren, and so also was his wife, both of whom are
now advancing together to meet the grand crisis of their destiny,
without any dread of the final issue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some time after Mr. Ryder's return to Aston, I received a letter
from him giving me a sketch of his tour, and urging me to redeem
the promise I had given him to pay the wedding visit. As the
autumn was advancing, I resolved to go at once; and I spent two
very pleasant weeks with him, visiting my other friends at intervals.
One evening we had at Mr. Lewellin's a large gathering of
some of the most prominent personages of my narrative, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
the Rev. John Roscoe and his lady, the Rev. O. Guion, Mr. and Mrs.
Stevens, and Mrs. Roscoe. As soon as we were comfortably seated,
with nothing to do but to partake of our friend's hospitality, and
enjoy the charm of social fellowship, the Rev. Mr. Roscoe, addressing
Mr. Guion, said, "Can you, Sir, tell me anything about my old
friends the Misses Brownjohn? The last time I heard of them they
were engaged in a lawsuit about a fortune, to which they supposed
themselves entitled by the death of their nephew.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Did they succeed
in getting it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir; and it was, I believe, a very large property. They
started their carriage immediately afterwards."</p>

<p>"Do you know how they got over the difficulties occasioned by
the non-production of the register of their birth and baptism?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how they got over the legal difficulties; but the
other difficulty was not got over to Miss Susan's satisfaction for a
long time after she came into the possession of the property."</p>

<p>"You refer, I presume, to the omission of her name in the parish
registry, recording the fact of her regeneration?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir."</p>

<p>"Such a document," Mrs. John Roscoe remarked, "must be of immense
value in the estimation of an unregenerated Tractarian. No
getting into heaven without it! A parish registrar must be a very
important functionary in the estimation of these High Church devotees.
If he fail in his duty, alas! their hope of salvation vanishes&mdash;they
are left to die in despair."</p>

<p>"To solve her difficulties," continued Mr. Guion, "Miss Susan applied
to the bishop's secretary to lay her case before his lordship for
his opinion. The reply was to this effect: that as she had taken the
sacrament for many years, and had a distinct recollection of having
been confirmed, and a faint recollection of her god-mother, it must
be taken for granted that she was baptized. But even this official
opinion from the highest ecclesiastical authority of the diocese, did
not quite satisfy her, though her sister, Miss Dorothy, often told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
it ought; and gave it as her opinion, that if there was any omission
she was sure the Almighty would overlook it."</p>

<p>"Against this, Miss Susan demurred. 'Take for granted what
ought to be positively certain! no, sister, I cannot do that.' She
was restless&mdash;ever going about from one aged person to another, in
the hopes of finding some one who would give her some information
as to her baptism. At length she found an old woman who recollected
hearing that her uncle Robert, who died young, used to be
spoken of in the family as her god-father. She followed up this
clue, and found a son of this uncle Robert, who, on looking through
an old account book, discovered the following entry:&mdash;'Paid for a
silver cup, given to my god-child, Susan Brownjohn, of Norton,
Â£3, 10s.' This cup she still had in her possession, bearing this inscription:&mdash;'The
gift of Robert Fenton.' This was hailed as an
unmistakeable evidence of her regeneration; and now she felt sure
of going to heaven when the Almighty took her from earth."</p>

<p>"How painfully absurd," said Mrs. John Roscoe, "to see an old
lady trotting about, without regarding wind or weather, in search
of the proof of her regeneration; or, in other words, of her title to
the kingdom of heaven! Are Miss Susan and Miss Dorothy still
alive?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dorothy is; but Miss Susan has been dead for nearly a
twelvemonth. It is generally supposed that her death was hastened
by her anxieties and exertions about the legitimate proof of her
baptismal regeneration. When symptoms of decay became alarming,
her sister engaged a professional nurse to wait upon her&mdash;an
intelligent old woman, who afterwards gave me the following account
of Miss Susan's last days:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The first time I saw her, she was in her own room, seated in a
high-backed arm-chair; the neatest room I ever saw-so clean, and
everything in such prim order. 'Now, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,' she said
to me, 'I forget your name, and therefore I shall call you Mrs. Nurse,
I am going to die, for Dr. Black told me when I asked him, that he
thought it probable that the Almighty was going to take me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
himself; and I suppose it must be so. Now, Mrs. Nurse, I have a
good many prayers to read; and a good deal to read out of this good
book, <cite>The Whole Duty of Man</cite>; and I like to get all my reading over
before tea, and then I can enjoy myself. You will now go out of
my room, and not come back till I ring, which, I suppose, will be in
about an hour's time.' However, the bell rung in about a quarter
of an hour, and Miss Dorothy and I entered the room together. 'I
can't,' she said to her sister, 'get through my reading so well as I
used to do. I get sleepy as soon as I begin. But I see the cup.'</p>

<p>"'O!' said Miss Dorothy, 'you are too scrupulous, dear sister;
the Almighty is sure to overlook it.'</p>

<p>"'I suppose he will; but I like to be particular. However, it's a
great comfort to me, to see the silver cup, the proof of my baptismal
regeneration; the thing necessary, you know, dear sister, to fit us
for heaven. I would not part with it for another fortune from the
Indies.'</p>

<p>"'I saw,' said the old nurse, 'a little old-fashioned silver cup on
the mantel-piece, on which she often looked with evident emotions
of pleasure: but I could not divine the reason, till one day she gave
me a detailed history of the whole matter. She then asked me
whether I was baptized at the church; and whether I had satisfied
myself that it was duly entered in the church register; assuring
me, that unless it was, I stood no chance of going to heaven. At
length,' continued the old woman, 'the crisis came.'</p>

<p>"'I suppose,' said Dr. Black to her, after examining her pulse very
carefully, 'you would like to take the sacrament, before the Almighty
takes you to himself?'</p>

<p>"'To be sure I should, Doctor; our Church appoints it.'</p>

<p>"'Shall I request your Rector, Mr. Guion, to call?'</p>

<p>"'To be sure not, Doctor. I never have had anything to do with
the Evangelicals while living, and they shan't come near me when
dying. No, no, Doctor; I'll keep to the clergy of the proper order&mdash;the
clergy of our fathers.'</p>

<p>"'Very good, Madam; I know your predilections.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Yes, Doctor; and my antipathies.'</p>

<p>"'The day and hour was fixed, and old Mr. Johnson, from Ottersley,
came to administer the sacrament; and Miss Susan was dressed for
the occasion, propped up with pillows in her high-backed arm-chair.
Soon after the ceremony was over, I saw,' said the old nurse, 'a
change, and I knew death was coming; Miss Dorothy was standing
by her side.' 'I feel,' she remarked, 'a queer sensation coming over
me. Give me a glass of water;' but she expired when in the act of
attempting to take the tumbler into her hand.'"</p>

<p>What a melancholy contrast this presents to the death of the
pious cottager, Mrs. Allen!<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was happy to hear from Mrs. John Roscoe, that the ministry
of her husband and his pious Curate was working moral wonders
amongst his parishioners. The church was uniformly crowded with
attentive hearers; the people flocked to it from distant villages and
hamlets. "But, Sir," she added, "my husband has to pay the usual
tax which is levied on all who distinguish themselves by their zeal
and energy, in exposing the absurdity and fatal tendency of the
popular superstitions, and trying to win souls to Christ. 'The most
favourable construction I can put on his conduct,' said an old clergyman,
in a large party, 'is this&mdash;he is a little beside himself.' I immediately
replied, 'It would be, reverend Sir, a great advantage to
many of your parishioners, if you also were a little beside yourself;
and then they would stop at home, and attend your ministrations,
instead of having to walk three or four miles every Sabbath to hear
my husband.' This startled him, as he did not know that I was present.
He then endeavoured to eke out an apology, which he would
have been much wiser to have let alone."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was sorry to hear that my old friend Farmer Pickford had
sustained an injury by the slip of the ladder on which he was standing
when lopping a tree, and that he had been confined to his bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
some weeks. On seeing me enter his room, he stretched forth his
hand, and said, "I thought, Sir, you would give me a bit of a call,
like. I am main glad to see you. Here I am, the Lord's prisoner.
I would rather be the Lord's prisoner than the devil's free man,
and no mistake."</p>

<p>"I hope the injury you have sustained is not likely to prove a
lasting one."</p>

<p>"Why, as for that, I can't say. But now and tan I think I shall
never be the man I was. I shall never be able to dig and trench,
and mow and thrash, as when I was a youngster. And, at my time
of life, I can't expect it. I am sixty-five come October. I tell you
what, Sir, I see mercy mixed up with this affliction; and, as one of
the Psalms says, I can sing of mercy and judgment. What a mercy
that my neck was not broken; and that I had no broken bones. I
never felt my heart so full of gratitude on going into my homestead
as I did the morning when I was brought in on the hurdle. I
couldn't help shedding some tears, like. The Lord be praised."</p>

<p>"Then you do not murmur, or feel disquieted?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Sir; not I. I an't going to commit that sin. I have
had much comfort while lying on this bed, and no mistake. My
mistress comes and sits by my side, and reads God's precious Book
to me. I get main fond of the Psalms: they are like upland springs,
they refresh my soul at once, like. And she comes, after church, on
a Sunday, and talks over the sarmunts she hears there; and they
come home to my heart. And Harry often comes, when he has
struck off work, and he reads a bit, and gives the meaning of it, in
his plain way, and what he says comes to my heart. So you see,
Sir, I have many mercies mixed up with this affliction."</p>

<p>"Well, Farmer, I am happy to find that you are still holding on
your way to the kingdom of heaven, and are full of peace and hope
as you move onwards."</p>

<p>"Why, Sir, I hope you didn't think I should turn back, when
you were gone. Turn back to the world and sin! and turn my back
on the precious Saviour, who had compassion on, and rescued me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
when I was a lost sinner! No, Sir; I would rather be hacked to
death first, and no mistake. But I mustn't feel boastful. I don't
keep myself. No. The Lord is my keeper. I mind a sarmunt
Mr. Ingleby preached one Sunday morning. It made me strongish
in faith, like; I got the text by heart before I took dinner, and I
can say it, without missing a word&mdash;'And I give unto them eternal
life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of my hand' (John x. 28)."</p>

<p>"The Psalmist says, 'It hath been good for me that I have been
afflicted;' and I suppose, Farmer, you can say the same?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, I can, and no mistake. I am main glad for this
affliction. It gives me a bit of breathing time, like; I can think over
spiritual matters now I am in this quiet room, better than I could
while busy at the farm work. It's all right. The Lord be praised."</p>

<p>"You expect, I suppose, that you shall soon get about again?"</p>

<p>"Why, as for that, I can't say. I have a main liking for this
room. It is so quiet, and my thoughts now and tan be so delightsome.
It's true I have had a power of pain and suffering, but this
has been overtopped by heart's ease and spiritual rejoicings. I
can say, what my mistress read out of the blessed book, 'The Lord
has made my bed in my affliction.' And here I am, willing to lie
still or get up, to suffer longer or go to farm work, just as the
Lord pleases. I a'nt much mindful about it."</p>

<p>"I suppose, Farmer, you have thought sometimes during your
confinement, about your departure from earth, to be with Christ?"</p>

<p>"Aye, that's it, and no mistake. T'other night, when I was
thinking a bit about dying and going into t'other world, I wondered
how I should feel when looking at Jesus Christ for the
first time, and what I should say to him, and what he would say
to me. These thinkings came to and again, with such power, that
tears streamed out of my eyes, and no mistake; and I wept on, till
I fell asleep."</p>

<p>"He will appear in his glory, when he comes to receive you to
himself; and it will be a glory very brilliant, yet it won't dazzle or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
confound you, as your power of vision will be equal to the grandeur
of the spectacle."</p>

<p>"What a marvellous wonder that he should ever take a bit of a
liking to such a wicked fellow as I was! But it's just like him.
When he was here, he looked out for the chief of sinners; after
them that are lost. I a'nt forgot your sarmunt in the barn about
Zaccheus. I shall think of it when I am in heaven, if I should
ever get there, as I hope I shall. And I shall have a bit of wish
to see him, as he had to see Jesus Christ, when he got up into the
sycamore tree."</p>

<p>I was much gratified by finding him in such a heavenly frame of
mind&mdash;so patient under his sufferings, so resigned to the Divine
will, so joyful in hope, and so strong in faith. I read a chapter,
making a few explanatory remarks, prayed with him, and left him;
but he would not let me go without a promise that I would see him
again.</p>

<p>On my next visit, I saw Mrs. Pickford, who appeared the picture
of grief. She wept, and said&mdash;"My dear husband has been very ill
the last two days, and in very great pain; I fear the Lord is going
to take him from me. However, I have the consolation of knowing,
that he has taken refuge in the ark of safety; he cleaves to the dear
Redeemer with all his heart. It is quite wonderful to hear how he
talks about the love of Christ; about feeling its power on his soul;
and about seeing him, and being made like him."</p>

<p>I went into his room, shook hands with him, and had a long conversation.
When speaking of the Saviour coming, in the spiritual
manifestations of his presence, to comfort and animate his disciples
in the chamber of affliction, or when entering death's dark vale, he
interrupted me by a burst of natural eloquence, which greatly delighted
us&mdash;"I can speak to the truth of what you say. He does
come and comfort my heart. I have had more heart-rejoicings in
this room, than I ever had at church or chapel, when hearkening to
sarmunts, and that is saying a great deal. My soul has been taken
up to the third heaven, and though I have not seen Jesus Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
with my bodily eyes as Paul did, yet I have felt the sweetness of his
love&mdash;the preciousness of his love, and no mistake. I say to my
wife, I say to my children, I say to my servants, and all my neighbours,
Take refuge in Christ, the living ark of safety, to save you
from the wrath to come; and love him with all your hearts, and
then when you die, He will come and comfort you, as he comes and
comforts me. I beg pardon, Sir, for stopping you, but I couldn't
hold no longer. My heart was too full."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is now a long time since I was last at Fairmount; but I frequently
correspond with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Lewellin, and hear
how matters are going on in that part of the country, of which,
though not my native place, I may truly say, from the pleasing
associations connected with it, in the words of Horace&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ille terrarum mibi prÃ¦ter omnes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Angulus ridet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>My friends Mr. and Mrs. Stevens continue as formerly in the
enjoyment of good health and spirits, and though advanced in years,
are still active in promoting the religious and moral improvement
of the villagers in their neighbourhood. Mr. and Mrs. Lewellin
have now a young family growing up about them; and Rockhill is
quite the admiration of the country round for the great improvements
effected on it by Mr. Lewellin, who, by diligent perseverance,
and the valuable services of his bailiff, Harry Pickford, has become
quite a scientific farmer. Mr. and Mrs. Ryder are very happy, with
two sweet children, a boy and a girl, and a constant interchange of
visits is kept up with Rockhill and Fairmount. Miss Ryder still
lives with them; but it is doubtful whether this will be the case
much longer, at least it is currently reported in the village that Mr.
Hartley, the Rector of Aston, is shortly to lead her to the altar, a
statement which receives some corroboration, from the circumstance
that the Rector has lately been getting his house repaired and newly
furnished. Mrs. Roscoe, shortly after her husband's death, took up
her abode with her daughter and son-in-law, where she receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
every attention and kindness, and looks tranquilly forward to joining
her beloved husband in a better world.</p>

<p>My old friend Farmer Pickford, after being confined for nearly
twelve months, gradually regained his health and his physical
energy, and is now become a hale old man, and has every prospect
of attaining a patriarchal age. A few months since I received from
him a basket of game, with the following characteristic note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;As you have left off honouring my wife's cookery,
she and I have been thinking that you would like to taste a bit
of our game in your own house. I shot the hares, and Harry killed
the partridges and the snipes. They are quite fresh&mdash;all killed yesterday.
We hope they will come safe. I am happy to say that all's
well at the homestead. We get a good sarmunt now and tan, in the
kitchen. I hope we shall all meet in heaven, and no mistake.&mdash;Yours
devoutly,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">John and Martha Pickford</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>His son George is now captain of a vessel, and Sam is his mate.
People say that Harry is to be married soon to a daughter of Farmer
Goddard; and if so, it is believed that he will leave his situation
at Rockhill, and occupy the adjoining farm, which will become
vacant at Michaelmas.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/i_606.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">The Author has now brought his labours to a close; and
having thus finally disposed of the various characters
in his story, it may justly be presumed that nothing
more remains to be done but simply to thank his
readers for their courteous attention to his narrative, and bid them
a hearty and respectful farewell. But, perhaps, before doing so, he
may be permitted to cast a retrospective glance on the course through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
which he and his readers have passed together, and review some
of the leading principles which he has endeavoured to illustrate and
enforce in the course of his work.</p>
</div>

<p>In commencing his labours, the Author of the <cite>Sheepfold and the
Common</cite> resolved to maintain a strict neutrality amid the various
conflicting sects in the Christian Church, and avoid everything like
an undue <em>clannishness</em> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>. Assuming a position midway
between the two principal religious parties which exist amongst
us&mdash;Church and Dissent&mdash;he resolved to hold the balance of judgment
and justice with an impartial hand&mdash;neither to lower the
one, nor unduly exalt the other&mdash;allowing each to retain its own
ecclesiastic polity, without presuming to encroach on the freedom
which both so equitably claim. He has, he admits, exposed some
of the imperfections of the Episcopal Establishment; but these very
imperfections have been pointed out and animadverted on by many
of its most intelligent and decided advocates and admirers, both of
the clergy and laity. In so doing, however, it has been very far
from his intention wantonly to impair the credit of the Church of
England, or alienate her members from her communion; but to
render his assistance in paving the way for a revision of her polity,
which is now so loudly called for, and which, in general belief, will
render her a greater and a more impressive instrument of moral
and spiritual power amongst the great mass of the people. He has
not attempted to set in hostile array against each other those who
are united in the same faith, though differing in denominational
opinions and practices. He has given no advice to a Churchman
or to a Dissenter which stands in opposition to the pure and catholic
spirit of the gospel; but he has endeavoured to induce all, from
a profound regard to the authority of Jesus Christ, as well as their
own moral dignity and happiness, "to add to their faith, virtue; and
to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance,
patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly
kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity" (2 Pet. i. 5-7).</p>

<p>His main object throughout the whole of his labours has been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
present, in a popular form, the leading doctrines of the Christian
faith; and to vindicate its integrity and purity against its ever-active
opponents; and to prove, at the same time, that it is a remedial
scheme to recover man from the ruin occasioned by the first
transgression, rather than a mere educational or ceremonial one. He
is aware that the heart of every man, while in an unenlightened and
unrenewed state, presents an impassable barrier against its claims;
but the regular marshalled forces of opposition are concentrated
within the fortresses of scepticism and superstition. Scepticism
assumes different phases, and takes various grounds of objection&mdash;alternately
denying the truthfulness of the historic records of Christianity&mdash;impugning
the credibility of its witnesses, and the rationality
of its doctrines&mdash;inveighing against the so-called arrogance of
its claims and requirements&mdash;and rejecting it as an ill-contrived
theory, which answers no other purpose than to gratify the visionary,
or affright the credulous. In the person of Mr. Gordon and
others, the Author has allowed scepticism to express its hostility to
Christianity; and the reader will form his own judgment of the way
in which the arguments put forth by infidelity have been met and
repelled. (See vol. i. pp. 96-104, 133-144, and 137; ii. 76-107.)</p>

<p>In endeavouring thus to explain and illustrate Evangelical doctrines,
the Author has necessarily been led, by the nature of his
subject, to expose and confute the various forms of heresy and theological
error which appear to be more especially characteristic of
the present age. On one of these&mdash;the Tractarian heresy&mdash;which
prevails to such a lamentable extent among many members of the
Church of England, he has deemed it expedient to dwell at considerable
length, and has frequently introduced the views maintained
by the High Church party, as a subject of disquisition. On
this point it may, perhaps, be necessary to enter somewhat into
detail, as to many persons the remarks on the doctrines professed
by the Tractarian body, and the animadversions on the teaching of
their clergymen, may appear somewhat severe and unwarranted.</p>

<p>It cannot, the Author conceives, be denied by any Christian, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
bows to the absolute authority of the Bible, and its obvious interpretation,
that the only way to obtain eternal life is by believing in
Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and that the spiritual regeneration
of the soul is a necessary pre-requisite and qualification for an
admission into the kingdom of heaven. But Tractarianism, like
Romanism, virtually ignores this scheme of mercy, by introducing
a ceremonial apparatus, by which a priestly power effects for its
deluded victims and devotees all that is necessary for final salvation,
without the concurrence of any supernatural grace, but what is supposed
to flow through the artificially prescribed channels. To expose
the absurdity, as well as the anti-Christian character of this heresy,
the Author has introduced, in the person of Mr. Roscoe, the character
of a devout and spiritually enlightened man, and in his brother,
the Rev. John Roscoe, that of an able and zealous advocate of the
Tractarian theory. The reader will form his own opinion on the
merits of the question at issue, and the force of the arguments maintained
by the supporters of the respective systems (i. 317-477).</p>

<p>No one, the Author thinks, can read the New Testament with
careful attention, without perceiving that the sacred writers treat
of two distinct orders of human beings&mdash;the natural, and the spiritual
man; the one enlightened and renovated, and living in mental
fellowship with God; the other, living through life under the
governing influence of his constitutional principles, and conventional
predilections and habits&mdash;in whose estimation, whether he be
a libertine or a religious devotee, the necessity of a mental regeneration
is viewed as a fiction, or a mere theological dogma. Hence,
it devolved on the Author, in a work of this description, to draw
plainly the broad line of distinction, which he thinks the intelligent
reader will discover he has done in his illustrative and confirmatory
examples, as well as by the simple process of reasoning, deducible
from the authoritative data of the inspired volume. (See vol. i. pp.
198, 342-346, 352-356; see also paper on <cite>Calm Discussion</cite>, i. 246, and
<cite>A Struggle for Life</cite>, ii. 493.)</p>

<p>This broad line of distinction between the two orders of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
becomes more marked and decisive when they are dying, or when
anticipating death. As an instance of this, the reader is presented
with a contrast in the narrative of the deathbed of Mrs. Allen
(i. 187, 188), as compared with that of Miss Susan Brownjohn
(ii. 568-570), and in the respective accounts of the last moments of
Mr. Ingleby, the Evangelical pastor; and Mr. Cole, the advocate of
Tractarian principles (ii. 523-528, 540-544).</p>

<p>In separate papers, which form essential parts of his work, he
has brought under the notice of his readers a variety of individual
cases, which may prove as beacons, or examples of great practical
utility. He would call the serious attention of the incautious, who
may be exposed to beguiling temptations, to the case of Mr. Lewellin
(i. 13), young Harvey (ii. 179), and Mr. Beaufoy (ii. 240).</p>

<p>To the case of the <small>ANXIOUS INQUIRER</small>, who is intensely concerned
for his salvation, the Author has paid great attention, by explaining
the <em>cause</em> of his mental disquietude, which is a penetrating conviction
of personal guilt, and a clear perception of its consequent
danger (i. 416 and 503).</p>

<p>The great question, <em>What must we do to be saved?</em> answered: see
<cite>An Escape from a False Refuge</cite> (i. 530); also, <cite>The Farm-house
Kitchen</cite> (ii. 292).</p>

<p>The spiritual perplexities to which all are subjected, in some
degree, while working out their salvation, are specified and adjusted,
and these are:&mdash;<em>The defective nature of repentance</em> (i. 176);
<em>the declension of spiritual enjoyments</em>, and <em>the want of an assurance
of final salvation</em> (ii. 159). See also Mrs. Loader's Letter (ii. 303).</p>

<p>In the person of Miss Roscoe we have a specimen of Christian
decision, its sacrifices, its struggles, its conflicts, its triumphs, and
its recompense of reward. Miss Holmes' religious history presents
a very different complexion; in her we see the good work of grace
beginning and advancing under favourable auspices; her conflicts
are mental, and the final issue is glorious. In the case of Miss
Emma Holmes is exhibited the painful consequences of duplicity
and headstrong rashness, in entering into the married state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing, in the opinion of the Author, has a more powerful influence
over the popular mind, to excite prejudice against Christianity,
and to lead the profane and sceptical to call in question its Divine
origin, than the multiplicity of sects which exist within the pale of
the visible church; especially when they perceive the bitter and
antagonistic spirit which they often cherish and express towards
each other. The evil of this and its remedy, the Author has endeavoured
to point out and illustrate (ii. 18-36.)</p>

<p>The Author has interwoven, in the progress of his work, many
specimens of the wonder-working power of the grace of God, in the
regeneration and conversion of persons of varying degree of moral
excellencies and of moral worthlessness; and of the diversified mode
of operation which is observed by the Divine Spirit when effecting
it. He would call the attention of the intelligent reader to the
following cases, which are so many living witnesses in confirmation
of the Divine origin and blissful tendency of the truth, by which
they are called out of a state of spiritual death to give their testimony:&mdash;Mr.
Lewellin (i. 23), the Rev. O. Guion (i. 76), Miss Roscoe
(i. 129), Mr. Tennent (i. 151), Mr. Roscoe (i. 278), Farmer Pickford
(i. 47, 392, 571), Miss Denham (i. 414), Rev. John Roscoe (i. 428),
Miss Osbourne, the Quakeress (i. 503), Mr. and Mrs. Lobeck (i. 528-544),
Mrs. Hastings&mdash;see <cite>The Effect of a Word Spoken in Season</cite>
(ii. 108), Mrs. Farrington&mdash;see <cite>The Farm-house Kitchen</cite> (ii. 284), Mr.
Ryder&mdash;see <cite>A Struggle for Life</cite> (ii. 493), Mr. Gordon (ii. 511-515).</p>

<p>That the papers are very unequal in point of interest and execution,
no one is more conscious of than the writer; but what he has
written, he wrote as well as he could when it was written; and he
must now leave it to be dealt with, just as the candid and impartial
critic may decide. He knows that perfection has never been
attained; and though he feels that partiality for his own productions
with which authors are charged, and to which they are compelled
to plead guilty, when they speak so as to be believed, yet he is not
vain enough to suppose that he has attained it. The work has its
faults, which he has not skill enough to conceal, nor temerity enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
to vindicate and if it possess no excellence, it will soon descend to
that state of oblivion from which no interest can redeem it.</p>

<p>"And now," to quote the language of an elegant author, "could
he flatter himself that any one would take half the pleasure in reading
his numbers which he has taken in writing them, he would not
fear the loss of his labour. The employment detached him from
the bustle and hurry of life, the din of politics, and the noise of
folly; vanity and vexation flew away for a season, care and disquietude
came not near his dwelling. He arose fresh as the morning
to his task; the silence of the night invited him to peruse it;
and he can truly say, that food and rest were not preferred before
it. Happier hours than those which have been spent in composing
them he never expects to see in this world: very pleasantly did
they pass, and moved smoothly and swiftly along; for when thus
engaged he counted no time. They are gone, but have left a relish
and a fragrance upon the mind; and the remembrance of them is
sweet."</p>

<p>It has been justly observed, that there are few things not purely
evil, of which we can say, without some emotion of uneasiness, <em>this
is the last</em>. Those who never could agree together, shed tears when
mutual discontent has determined them to final separation. Of a
place which has been frequently visited, though without pleasure,
the last look is taken with heaviness of heart; and the Author,
who has by a series of papers contributed to the improvement and
gratification of society, may expect to be forgiven, if he should feel
some novel sensations pervading his breast, when his last essay is
before him.</p>

<p>Thus in the planning and execution of our schemes, life passes
away, and we advance by unconscious steps towards its termination;
and though by a singular species of artifice we contrive to keep our
latter end in some distant perspective of futurity, yet in our more
serious moments of reflection we feel that it is approaching. And
can we anticipate it with cool indifference? Can we think of taking
a last look at the varied beauties of nature, which have so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
charmed the eye&mdash;of hearing the last words of friendship, which
have so often delighted the ear&mdash;of uttering the last adieu which
is to separate us from all communion with the inhabitants of earth&mdash;without
feeling a degree of pensive sadness, which nothing can relieve
but the hope of a blissful immortality? And even when this
hope breaks in upon our solemn musings, and dispels the gloom
which envelopes them, it is not always in our power to regain that
tranquillity which the approach of our <em>last</em> hour tends to disturb.
Our <em>last</em> hour! It may now be distant, but ere long it will be near.
Suppose it were now come! Suppose only sixty more minutes of time
were allotted to us on earth! Suppose we were now within a few, a
very few steps of the seat of final judgment! Suppose in a few
moments we should be called to give an account of the deeds done
in the body, whether good or evil! Suppose, ere the village clock
proclaims to the rustic inhabitants the departure of <em>another hour</em>, we
should be doomed to receive the decisive sentence, which will</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noind">what would be the state of our mind? Should we be calm, like the
woodman, who after the toils of the day, goes home to enjoy his rest?
or should we be alarmed, as when the mariner sees the first symptoms
of the rising storm? Should we be in ecstasy, as when the captive
is released from the prison-house of wretchedness, and restored to
his home? or should we turn pale, and tremble like the condemned
criminal, when he hears the first sound of his own funeral knell?
These are questions which we may now dismiss under an apprehension
that they relate to a remote period; but that period is not so
remote, as when the questions first met the eye of the reader; and
ere long it will be <em>the present time</em>. Are we prepared to live through
our last hour; and to give up our life, when the last pulse shall beat
through our veins, without wishing to prolong it? Are we ready to
step across the boundary which divides the visible from the invisible
world, without faltering in our passage? If so, we may live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
peace. We need fear no evil. We may range into futurity, without
being appalled by any rising forms of terror. We may anticipate
the last hour with tranquil joy, and calmly wait its approach. But
if not, we ought to feel alarm. To be gay and sportive when treading
on the verge of eternal woe, would be no less than a species of
mental delirium. It would be an act of criminal folly; a treasuring
up to ourselves wrath against the day of wrath; and impiously
smiling as the storm of the Divine displeasure is accumulating its
stores of vengeance.</p>

<p>Let me, then, before I have taken my final farewell of my reader,
urge him once more to "work out his own salvation with fear and
trembling." Let me once more point his attention to "the Lamb
of God, that taketh away the sin of the world." Let me once more
tell him, in the language which fell from the lips of the Redeemer,
when he was on the earth:&mdash;"He that believeth on the Son hath
everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
but the wrath of God abideth on him."</p>

<p>I have now done; and commending my well-meant though imperfect
labours to the blessing of Him who alone can render them
effectual to the salvation of my readers, I now retire to the more
private duties of my station, yet not without indulging the hope of
meeting some in the celestial world, to whom I have been the means
of imparting consolation, while passing through this valley of
weeping.</p>

an intelligent son of this eminent Christian requests that the name of the deceased may

God be merciful to me a sinner! and his last word, the name of that Redeemer on

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The following anecdote of George III. (from <cite>Legends and Records</cite>, chiefly Historical:
by Charles Tayler, M.A.), supplies us with another interesting case of the aptitude of
the mind to understand and feel the power of religious truth, after it has become inaccessible
to every other mental communication. His majesty had been hunting in Windsor
Forest, and after the hunt was over, as he was returning, his attention was arrested
by a little girl who sat on the ground weeping. He alighted from his horse, and, having
ascertained the cause of her grief, he followed her to a tent, in an unfrequented part of
the forest, where lay an old gipsy on her dying bed, with her face towards the inside of
the tent. She appeared too far gone to hear any of the sympathetic inquiries which
he instituted. However, his eye was attracted by a torn and dirty book, which lay
open upon the pillow of the dying woman, and he had the curiosity to see what book
it was.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, Sir," said an elder girl, "I believe there's a deal of fine reading in that book;
and my grandmother set great store by it, torn and soiled as it is. While she could use
her eyes she used to be spelling it over and over again; but now, she says, the letters are
all dark and dim before her sight, she cannot see them."
</p>
<p>
His majesty said nothing, but, taking up the book from the pillow, he sat down on
the green turf close to the head of the dying woman. The book was the Bible. He chose
some of those beautiful passages which are easy to be understood, and, at the same time,
full of hope and comfort to the sinking and fearful heart. He read of the tender compassion
of the Father of mercies to his guilty creatures, in giving his own Son Jesus Christ
to die for them, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life! Though she heard not what he said when he first spoke to her, she heard and felt
the words of the Scriptures, for she turned entirely round and opened her dull eyes with
a vacant stare; she endeavoured also to speak, but could only make a faint uncertain
sound, in which no word could be distinguished. Then she drew her hands together, and
clasped them as if in prayer, taking that way, it seemed, to show that she was quite sensible
to hear and understand what was read to her; and the young girls drew near, and
kneeled down quietly beside the bed, listening also to the sacred words of life, and feeling
a sort of happiness in their sorrow, as they looked upon their beloved parent, now as calm
as a sleeping infant, except that tears stole down her hollow cheeks; but any one might
see that they were tears of joy, for all the while a smile was on her lips.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The sceptic will sometimes endeavour to perplex and entangle the faith of an unlearned
believer, by insinuating that, as he has never traced, through the medium of
exact evidence, the origin of the different books of the Bible to their source, he cannot
be assured that his belief is substantially a true belief&mdash;it may be, after all, nothing but
the belief of a fiction. The following quotation from a distinguished writer, will, I
think, prove as a shield of defence to the faith of the unlearned, and convince the sceptic
himself, that his objection, plausible in appearance, is wanting in logical force:&mdash;"It is
manifest that the concurrent testimony, positive or negative, of several witnesses, when
there can have been no concert, carries with it a weight independent of that which may
belong to each of them, considered separately. For though, in such a case, each of the
witnesses should be even considered as wholly undeserving of credit, still the chances
might be incalculable against all agreeing in the <em>same</em> falsehood. It is on this kind of
testimony that the generality of mankind believe in the motions of the earth, and of the
heavenly bodies, &amp;c. Their belief is not the result of their own observations and calculations,
nor yet again of their implicit reliance on the skill and good faith of any one or
more astronomers; but it rests on the agreement of many independent and rival astronomers,
who want neither the ability nor the will to detect and expose each other's
errors. It is on similar grounds that the generality of men believe in the existence and
in the genuineness of manuscripts of ancient books. It is not that they have themselves
examined these, or that they rely implicitly on the good faith of those who profess to
have done so; but they rely on the <em>concurrent</em> and <em>uncontradicted</em> testimony of all who
have made, or who <em>might make</em>, the examination&mdash;both unbelievers and believers of
various hostile sects, any one of whom would be sure to seize any opportunity to expose
the forgeries or errors of his opponents."&mdash;<em>Whately.</em>
</p>
<p>
This observation is the more important because many persons are liable to be startled
and dismayed, on its being pointed out to them that they have been believing something,
as they are led to suppose, on very insufficient reasons, when the truth is, perhaps, that
they have been merely mis-stating their reasons.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> "No such a thing," says Archbishop Whately, "is to be found in our Scriptures as a
catechism, or regular <em>elementary introduction</em> to the <em>Christian religion</em>; nor do they
furnish us with anything of the nature of a systematic creed, set of articles, confession of
faith, or by whatever other name one may designate a regular, complete compendium
of Christian doctrines; nor, again, do they supply us with a liturgy for ordinary public
worship, or with forms for administering the sacraments, or for conferring holy orders;
nor do they even give any precise <em>directions</em> as to these and other ecclesiastical matters&mdash;anything
that at all corresponds to a rubric, or set of canons." Why these omissions?
A great defect in our Scriptures, say some; but, in my opinion, it amounts to a self-evident
confirmation, that the writers of the New Testament were under the special
dictation of the Divine Spirit, as to what they <em>should</em>, and what they <em>should not</em> record.
If they were carrying out a fraudulent design, conceived by their predecessors, who wrote
the Old Testament, they would, from their educational training and desire to act in
character with their confederates, have imitated their example, and been very specific
and minute in all their ecclesiastic arrangements. They would have inserted the law of
dictation and prescription, which was so absolute under the Jewish theocracy, in the
Christian code, and thus have rendered division of opinion and freedom of action impossible.
The question then turns upon us: Why did they not do what it was very natural
they should do, and what the necessity of the case would seem to require to be done,
according to the judgment of every intelligent and reflective mind, who looked at it
through the medium of the existing ecclesiastical regulations of the age and country?
Their <em>not doing</em> what was thus natural <em>they should do</em>, and what the necessity of the case,
according to human judgment, <em>required them to do</em>, is of itself a proof that they were not
left to the guidance of their own understanding, but were held in subjection, according
to their own confession, by the controlling power and wisdom of the Holy Ghost, under
whose inspiration all Scripture is given. "The Jewish ritual, designed for one nation
and country, and intended to be of temporary duration, was fixed and accurately prescribed.
The same Divine wisdom, from which both dispensations proceeded, having
designed Christianity for all nations and ages, left Christians at large in respect of those
points in which variation might be desirable. But I think no <em>human</em> wisdom would
have foreseen and provided for this. That a number of <em>Jews</em>, accustomed from their
infancy to so strict a ritual, should, in introducing Christianity as the second part of the
same dispensation, have abstained not only from accurately prescribing for the use of all
Christian churches for ever the mode of Divine worship, but even from recording what
was actually in use under their own directions, does seem to me utterly incredible, unless<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">we suppose them to have been restrained from doing this by a special admonition of the</span><br />
Divine Spirit."&mdash;<em>Whately.</em>
</p>
<p>
At any rate, whether these omissions are to be attributed to the controlling power of
the Holy Ghost, or the extraordinary policy of the writers of the New Testament, we
arrive at the same conclusion, that, while we are required to believe, and to contend
earnestly for the essential facts and doctrines of the Christian faith, which are set out
with great precision and explicitness, a freedom of action is allowed on what may be
deemed the subordinate and non-essential parts of the same faith. Hence we may differ
on some things, without any valid impeachment of our Christian wisdom and integrity,
unless we allow our difference of opinion to produce alienation of brotherly affection.
When it does this, we make a sacrifice of our honour, and give a sanction to the accusation
of the common adversary, that our hostile divisions are a proof that our religion
does not come from a wise and benevolent Being&mdash;that it is of the earth, earthy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In 1845 Sir Robert Peel introduced a measure, and carried it, to increase this grant
to nearly Â£30,000 a-year.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> When Lord John Russell was speaking in favour of the measure brought before the
house by Sir Robert Peel in 1845, to increase the grant to nearly Â£30,000 per annum, he
said&mdash;"But if you found you were doing that which was mischievous to the community,
and that the religious scruples of the community would not allow of the continuance of
the grant, or, with reference to civil and political reasons, you found that those you
meant to be teachers of religion had become the teachers and conductors of rebellion; if
I say," his lordship added, "you found from any of these causes that there was ground
sufficient to refuse this grant, then I can see no valid reasons why any compact should
restrain you, or why, upon strong grounds of this kind, the house would not be justified
in declaring that it would give no further allowance." (See Hansard's <cite>Debates</cite>, v. 3,
p. 92, session 1845.) The Right Hon. William Gladstone, M.P., recorded his opinion of
this grant, before Sir Robert Peel brought forward his measure in 1845. "In principle
the grant is wholly vicious, and it will be a thorn in the side of these countries as long
as it is continued." There are several reasons, which, in the judgment of Lord John
Russell, would justify the discontinuance of this grant, without subjecting our government
to the charge of violating any existing compact; but I merely mention the following,
which I give from the speech of his lordship: if "<em>the religious scruples of the community
would not allow of the continuance of it</em>." Now let us see how the case actually
stands, and then we shall be able to form a correct judgment of what the British government
and we ourselves ought to do. It is an undisputed fact, that the measure of 1845
was forced through parliament in direct opposition to the most unequivocal expression
of hostility on the part of the religious community, of all denominations; and their hostility
to its continuance is increasing in inveteracy and strength as time moves on in its
course. I am at a loss to conceive how any one except a Roman Catholic who has a
beneficial interest in this money grant, or a lukewarm Protestant, who cares no more
for the spiritual religion of the New Testament than he does for the legendary tales of
Popery, can come forward as its advocate and supporter. The Catholics say they are
able and willing to support their own religion and its institutions. Let them do so;
but do not compel us to work with them, when we believe that their religion, with its
institutions, is the greatest curse that ever has been inflicted on man since the Fall;
and when we believe that its clergy, if they had the power, would immediately establish
the Inquisition amongst us, and at once consign us to torture and to death, if we
refused to bow down and to do homage to their pontiff and his myrmidons.</p></div>

"An order has just been promulgated by the magistrate of Poonah, under instructions
from government, prohibiting hook-swinging and other barbarous practices throughout
the Poonah Zillah. Such a measure has long been desired by all who wish for the improvement
of the natives. Of old it was believed&mdash;or careless and idle minds found it
convenient to believe&mdash;that it was dangerous to meddle with any native practice, however
immoral or revolting, that was connected with or claimed the sanction of religion.
But times are changed, and innovations which might not safely have been attempted a
century or half a century ago, the age is now ripe for.

"Another barbarous custom, also prevalent at Jejooree, is interdicted by the proclamation
of Mr. Davidson. A man runs a sword through the fleshy part of his leg for
about a foot, and, drawing it out, sprinkles the blood on the entrance of the temple. For
this feat he receives large free-will offerings; and the right to perform it is vested, as a
valuable privilege, in a body of about fifteen families, to each individual of which it
comes round once in about six or seven years. These men, however, long ago declared
that they would be glad to discontinue the practice (which some think is a remnant of
the rite of human sacrifice) if their incomes could be assured to them."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The author knows a lady who, when young, requested her pious father to permit her
to learn to dance. "No, my child," he replied, "I cannot consent to comply with a
request which may subject me to your censures at some future period." "No, father, I
will never censure you for complying with my request." "Nor can I consent to give you
an opportunity. If you learn, I have no doubt but you will excel; and when you leave
school, you may then want to go into company to exhibit your skill. If I then object to
let you, as I most likely should, you would very naturally reply, Why, father, did you
permit me to learn, if I am not permitted to practise?" This reply convinced her that
her father acted wisely, though he opposed her inclination: and though she did learn,
yet, not having his consent, she never ventured to expose herself to the dangers of the
assembly-room; as she well knew that she could not do it without grieving her affectionate
father. She is now become a parent; has often mentioned this occurrence as
having had a powerful moral influence over her mind in her young and thoughtless days;
and has incorporated this maxim in her system of domestic management&mdash;Never to comply
with a request which may subject her to any future reflections from her children.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The author has known some professors of evangelical religion who have occasionally
frequented these scenes of amusement; and though he would not condemn them as insincere
in their religious profession, yet he cannot conceive how they can approve of their
own conduct. If they go occasionally, others will feel at liberty to go habitually; and
though they may go, and retire without sustaining any material injury to their principles,
yet they know not how much injury their example may do to others, and especially
their own children.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Miss Moss was a young lady of rare accomplishments&mdash;the only child of a pious and
affectionate mother. Shortly after leaving school, she succeeded, with much difficulty,
in obtaining her mother's reluctant consent to go <em>once</em> to the assembly-room, just to see
the parties. She was dressed most elegantly; and having a graceful form, and a fine
open countenance, glowing with health, she excited considerable attention. One gentleman,
who had been very polite during the evening, and who was her superior in rank,
solicited the honour of conducting her home, which was granted. Having ascertained
the usual time and place of her evening walk, he met her&mdash;made her an offer, which she
accepted; when, having secured her affections, he accomplished her ruin, and left her.
This broke her mother's heart, and eventually broke her own; and the parent and the
daughter were buried in the same grave, at the distance of about six months from each
other's funeral, each deploring, when too late, the danger resulting from the assembly-room.
Nor is this an uncommon instance. At these places the spirits of evil resort,
availing themselves of the freedom of intercourse which is tolerated; and having marked
their victim, they proceed, with all the cunning and duplicity of the author of all evil,
to accomplish their unhallowed purpose. If, then, parents wish to preserve the honour of
their children uncontaminated, or if females, who are grown to years of discretion, wish
to avoid the snares in which others have been overtaken, they ought to shun the resorts
of the licentious and impure, as no one can be safe in their society.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> In connection with the above subject, the author may be permitted to narrate the
two following cases which occurred a few years since in the town where he then resided:&mdash;The
chief actors in the scenes to be described were persons occupying a respectable station
in society, and who habitually associated with intelligent and pious people. He
and his wife accepted an invitation to dine with a large party. The dinner was laid out
in first-rate style, grace was said with becoming solemnity, and we took our seats in due
form, when our hostess rose suddenly and rushed out of the room, pale and affrighted,
as though the turkey which she was preparing to dismember had suddenly metamorphosed
itself into a hobgoblin. We then heard her exclaim, when she found herself
alone in the hall, nearly breathless with terror, "O dear, O dear! there are thirteen!"
I looked at my wife and she looked at me, in utter amazement, wondering what presage
of coming evil could lurk under the number <em>thirteen</em>. At length our good-natured host
said to one of his daughters, "Eliza, you must retire, and we will send your plate to you
in the other room. You know your Mamma's objection to sit down at the table with such
an unlucky number." Eliza quietly withdrew, and then her mother silently entered,
almost as pale as a corpse, but her natural colour returned soon after she commenced her
carving labours. <em>Thirteen</em> an unlucky number! How odd! I could not make it out,
and continued to puzzle my head with it during dinner. However, we were informed,
before the party broke up, that one person was sure to die very soon after eating a hearty
dinner with <em>twelve</em>, however hale and vigorous they might all be.
</p>
<p>
The other case is as follows:&mdash;A friend of the author had been married, and he and his
wife went to pay the customary wedding visit. The sister of the bride was in waiting to
receive the company; her mother keeping watch, to see that everything was done in due
order. There was a goodly muster of persons, including uncles and aunts, first and
second cousins, and friends and acquaintances almost without number. At last the
uncle of the bride, a fine portly man, made his appearance, and was in the act of entering
the parlour with his hearty congratulations to his niece, when the door was suddenly
and rather unceremoniously slammed to by his sister, as though he had been some grim
demon, bent on mischief. "Daniel, don't come in; Daniel, you must not come in;
Daniel, you shan't come in," exclaimed the lady. "What's the matter now?" said Daniel,
who apparently was as much surprised at not being permitted to see us as we were at not
being permitted to see him. "What's the matter!" re-echoed his sister; "<em>why, you have
got your black coat on!</em>" Daniel was obliged to doff his black coat and put on a blue
one, made for a much smaller man, and then he appeared amongst us. Moving nearly as
gracefully as a man would do in a strait waistcoat, his appearance was a severe tax on our
gravity. The mystery of the black coat rejected, and the blue coat honoured by a presentation,
still remained unsolved to my wife and myself, till we overheard a grave matron
say, "It was very lucky, as the dear creature wouldn't die now." That is, as was
more fully explained afterwards, the black coat would have betokened the death of the
bride, if she had seen it. Alas! poor human nature. What a specimen of its absurdity
and folly! The black coat of the author was invested with no fatal presage, as he belonged
to the clerical order; otherwise, like Uncle Daniel, he must have changed it before
he could have tasted a bit of the wedding cake.</p></div>

<div class="tn"><h3>Transcriber's note:</h3>
<p>Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note. Irregularities and inconsistencies in the text have been retained as printed. Quotation marks are inconsistent; mismatched quotes are not fixed if it's not sufficiently clear where the missing quote should be placed.</p>

<p>The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up paragraphs, thus the page number of the illustration might not match the page number in the List of Illustrations.</p>

<p>Page 174: The missing word "it" has been added by the transcriber:  "we are satisfied that it is our duty to hear the gospel".</p>
